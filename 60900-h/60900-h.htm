  <h2 class='c011'>EDITOR’S NOTE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The projector of this Series has had in mind the
evident desire of our people, largely occupied with material
affairs, for reading in a shape adapted to the amount
of time at their disposal. Until recently this desire has
been satisfied chiefly from foreign sources. Many reprints
and translations of the little classics of other
literatures than our own have been made, and much
good has been done in this way. On the other hand,
a great deal of rubbish has been distributed in the same
fashion, to the undoubted injury of our popular taste.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now that a reasonable copyright law allows the publication
of the better class of native literature at moderate
prices, it has seemed fitting that these volumes
should consist mainly of works by American writers.
As its title indicates, the “Fiction, Fact, and Fancy
Series” will include not only fiction and poetry, but
such essays, monographs, and biographical sketches as
may appear, from time to time, to be called for.</p>

<p class='c013'>To no writer can the term “American” more justly
be applied than to the humorist whose “Merry Tales”
are here presented. It was in an effort to devise
some novel method of bringing these stories, new and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>old, before the public, that this Series had its origin.
But, aside from this, those among us who can gather
figs of thistles are so few in number as to make their
presence eminently desirable.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>THE PRIVATE HISTORY OF A CAMPAIGN THAT FAILED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>You have heard from a great many people
who did something in the war; is it not
fair and right that you listen a little moment
to one who started out to do something in it,
but didn’t? Thousands entered the war, got
just a taste of it, and then stepped out again,
permanently. These, by their very numbers,
are respectable, and are therefore entitled to a
sort of voice,—not a loud one, but a modest
one; not a boastful one, but an apologetic one.
They ought not to be allowed much space
among better people—people who did something—I
grant that; but they ought at least to
be allowed to state why they didn’t do anything,
and also to explain the process by which
they didn’t do anything. Surely this kind of
light must have a sort of value.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Out West there was a good deal of confusion
in men’s minds during the first months of the
great trouble—a good deal of unsettledness,
of leaning first this way, then that, then the
other way. It was hard for us to get our
bearings. I call to mind an instance of this.
I was piloting on the Mississippi when the news
came that South Carolina had gone out of the
Union on the 20th of December, 1860. My
pilot-mate was a New Yorker. He was strong
for the Union; so was I. But he would not
listen to me with any patience; my loyalty was
smirched, to his eye, because my father had
owned slaves. I said, in palliation of this dark
fact, that I had heard my father say, some
years before he died, that slavery was a great
wrong, and that he would free the solitary negro
he then owned if he could think it right to
give away the property of the family when he
was so straitened in means. My mate retorted
that a mere impulse was nothing—anybody
could pretend to a good impulse; and went on
decrying my Unionism and libeling my ancestry.
A month later the secession atmosphere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>had considerably thickened on the Lower Mississippi,
and I became a rebel; so did he. We
were together in New Orleans, the 26th of January,
when Louisiana went out of the Union.
He did his full share of the rebel shouting, but
was bitterly opposed to letting me do mine.
He said that I came of bad stock—of a father
who had been willing to set slaves free. In the
following summer he was piloting a Federal
gun-boat and shouting for the Union again,
and I was in the Confederate army. I held his
note for some borrowed money. He was one
of the most upright men I ever knew; but he
repudiated that note without hesitation, because
I was a rebel, and the son of a man who
owned slaves.</p>

<p class='c013'>In that summer—of 1861—the first wash of
the wave of war broke upon the shores of Missouri.
Our State was invaded by the Union
forces. They took possession of St. Louis, Jefferson
Barracks, and some other points. The
Governor, Claib Jackson, issued his proclamation
calling out fifty thousand militia to repel
the invader.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>I was visiting in the small town where my
boyhood had been spent—Hannibal, Marion
County. Several of us got together in a secret
place by night and formed ourselves into
a military company. One Tom Lyman, a
young fellow of a good deal of spirit but of
no military experience, was made captain; I
was made second lieutenant. We had no first
lieutenant; I do not know why; it was long
ago. There were fifteen of us. By the advice
of an innocent connected with the organization,
we called ourselves the Marion Rangers.
I do not remember that any one found fault
with the name. I did not; I thought it sounded
quite well. The young fellow who proposed
this title was perhaps a fair sample of the kind
of stuff we were made of. He was young, ignorant,
good-natured, well-meaning, trivial,
full of romance, and given to reading chivalric
novels and singing forlorn love-ditties. He
had some pathetic little nickel-plated aristocratic
instincts, and detested his name, which
was Dunlap; detested it, partly because it
was nearly as common in that region as Smith,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>but mainly because it had a plebeian sound to
his ear. So he tried to ennoble it by writing
it in this way: <em>d’Unlap</em>. That contented his
eye, but left his ear unsatisfied, for people gave
the new name the same old pronunciation—emphasis
on the front end of it. He then did
the bravest thing that can be imagined,—a
thing to make one shiver when one remembers
how the world is given to resenting shams
and affectations; he began to write his name so:
<em>d’Un Lap</em>. And he waited patiently through
the long storm of mud that was flung at this
work of art, and he had his reward at last; for
he lived to see that name accepted, and the
emphasis put where he wanted it, by people
who had known him all his life, and to whom
the tribe of Dunlaps had been as familiar as
the rain and the sunshine for forty years. So
sure of victory at last is the courage that can
wait. He said he had found, by consulting
some ancient French chronicles, that the name
was rightly and originally written d’Un Lap;
and said that if it were translated into English
it would mean Peterson: <em>Lap</em>, Latin or Greek,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>he said, for stone or rock, same as the French
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pierre</span></i>, that is to say, Peter; <em>d’</em>, of or from;
<em>un</em>, a or one; hence, d’Un Lap, of or from a
stone or a Peter; that is to say, one who is
the son of a stone, the son of a Peter—Peterson.
Our militia company were not learned,
and the explanation confused them; so they
called him Peterson Dunlap. He proved useful
to us in his way; he named our camps for
us, and he generally struck a name that was
“no slouch,” as the boys said.</p>

<p class='c013'>That is one sample of us. Another was Ed
Stevens, son of the town jeweler,—trim-built,
handsome, graceful, neat as a cat; bright, educated,
but given over entirely to fun. There
was nothing serious in life to him. As far as
he was concerned, this military expedition of
ours was simply a holiday. I should say that
about half of us looked upon it in the same way;
not consciously, perhaps, but unconsciously.
We did not think; we were not capable of it.
As for myself, I was full of unreasoning joy to
be done with turning out of bed at midnight
and four in the morning, for a while; grateful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>to have a change, new scenes, new occupations,
a new interest. In my thoughts that
was as far as I went; I did not go into
the details; as a rule one doesn’t at twenty-four.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another sample was Smith, the blacksmith’s
apprentice. This vast donkey had some pluck,
of a slow and sluggish nature, but a soft heart;
at one time he would knock a horse down for
some impropriety, and at another he would
get homesick and cry. However, he had one
ultimate credit to his account which some of
us hadn’t: he stuck to the war, and was killed
in battle at last.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jo Bowers, another sample, was a huge,
good-natured, flax-headed lubber; lazy, sentimental,
full of harmless brag, a grumbler by
nature; an experienced, industrious, ambitious,
and often quite picturesque liar, and yet not a
successful one, for he had had no intelligent
training, but was allowed to come up just any
way. This life was serious enough to him,
and seldom satisfactory. But he was a good
fellow anyway, and the boys all liked him. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>was made orderly sergeant; Stevens was made
corporal.</p>

<p class='c013'>These samples will answer—and they are
quite fair ones. Well, this herd of cattle started
for the war. What could you expect of them?
They did as well as they knew how, but really
what was justly to be expected of them? Nothing,
I should say. That is what they did.</p>

<p class='c013'>We waited for a dark night, for caution and
secrecy were necessary; then, toward midnight,
we stole in couples and from various directions
to the Griffith place, beyond the town;
from that point we set out together on foot.
Hannibal lies at the extreme southeastern
corner of Marion County, on the Mississippi
River; our objective point was the hamlet of
New London, ten miles away, in Ralls County.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first hour was all fun, all idle nonsense
and laughter. But that could not be kept up.
The steady trudging came to be like work; the
play had somehow oozed out of it; the stillness
of the woods and the somberness of the night
began to throw a depressing influence over the
spirits of the boys, and presently the talking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>died out and each person shut himself up in his
own thoughts. During the last half of the
second hour nobody said a word.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now we approached a log farm-house where,
according to report, there was a guard of five
Union soldiers. Lyman called a halt; and
there, in the deep gloom of the overhanging
branches, he began to whisper a plan of assault
upon that house, which made the gloom
more depressing than it was before. It was a
crucial moment; we realized, with a cold suddenness,
that here was no jest—we were standing
face to face with actual war. We were
equal to the occasion. In our response there
was no hesitation, no indecision: we said
that if Lyman wanted to meddle with those
soldiers, he could go ahead and do it; but if he
waited for us to follow him, he would wait a
long time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lyman urged, pleaded, tried to shame us,
but it had no effect. Our course was plain, our
minds were made up: we would flank the farm-house—go
out around. And that is what we did.</p>

<p class='c013'>We struck into the woods and entered upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>a rough time, stumbling over roots, getting
tangled in vines, and torn by briers. At last
we reached an open place in a safe region, and
sat down, blown and hot, to cool off and nurse
our scratches and bruises. Lyman was annoyed,
but the rest of us were cheerful; we had flanked
the farm-house, we had made our first military
movement, and it was a success; we had
nothing to fret about, we were feeling just the
other way. Horse-play and laughing began
again; the expedition was become a holiday
frolic once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then we had two more hours of dull trudging
and ultimate silence and depression; then,
about dawn, we straggled into New London,
soiled, heel-blistered, fagged with our little
march, and all of us except Stevens in a sour
and raspy humor and privately down on the
war. We stacked our shabby old shot-guns in
Colonel Ralls’s barn, and then went in a body
and breakfasted with that veteran of the Mexican
War. Afterwards he took us to a distant
meadow, and there in the shade of a tree we
listened to an old-fashioned speech from him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>full of gunpowder and glory, full of that adjective-piling,
mixed metaphor, and windy declamation
which was regarded as eloquence in
that ancient time and that remote region; and
then he swore us on the Bible to be faithful to
the State of Missouri and drive all invaders
from her soil, no matter whence they might
come or under what flag they might march.
This mixed us considerably, and we could not
make out just what service we were embarked
in; but Colonel Ralls, the practiced politician
and phrase-juggler, was not similarly in doubt;
he knew quite clearly that he had invested us
in the cause of the Southern Confederacy. He
closed the solemnities by belting around me
the sword which his neighbor, Colonel Brown,
had worn at Buena Vista and Molino del Rey;
and he accompanied this act with another impressive
blast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then we formed in line of battle and marched
four miles to a shady and pleasant piece of
woods on the border of the far-reaching expanses
of a flowery prairie. It was an enchanting
region for war—our kind of war.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>We pierced the forest about half a mile, and
took up a strong position, with some low, rocky,
and wooded hills behind us, and a purling,
limpid creek in front. Straightway half the
command were in swimming, and the other
half fishing. The ass with the French name
gave this position a romantic title, but it was
too long, so the boys shortened and simplified
it to Camp Ralls.</p>

<p class='c013'>We occupied an old maple-sugar camp,
whose half-rotted troughs were still propped
against the trees. A long corn-crib served for
sleeping quarters for the battalion. On our
left, half a mile away, was Mason’s farm and
house; and he was a friend to the cause.
Shortly after noon the farmers began to arrive
from several directions, with mules and horses
for our use, and these they lent us for as long
as the war might last, which they judged would
be about three months. The animals were of
all sizes, all colors, and all breeds. They were
mainly young and frisky, and nobody in the
command could stay on them long at a time;
for we were town boys, and ignorant of horsemanship.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The creature that fell to my share
was a very small mule, and yet so quick and
active that it could throw me without difficulty;
and it did this whenever I got on it. Then it
would bray—stretching its neck out, laying its
ears back, and spreading its jaws till you could
see down to its works. It was a disagreeable
animal, in every way. If I took it by the bridle
and tried to lead it off the grounds, it would sit
down and brace back, and no one could budge
it. However, I was not entirely destitute of
military resources, and I did presently manage
to spoil this game; for I had seen many a steamboat
aground in my time, and knew a trick or
two which even a grounded mule would be
obliged to respect. There was a well by the
corn-crib; so I substituted thirty fathom of
rope for the bridle, and fetched him home with
the windlass.</p>

<p class='c013'>I will anticipate here sufficiently to say that
we did learn to ride, after some days’ practice,
but never well. We could not learn to like
our animals; they were not choice ones, and
most of them had annoying peculiarities of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>one kind or another. Stevens’s horse would
carry him, when he was not noticing, under
the huge excrescences which form on the
trunks of oak-trees, and wipe him out of the
saddle; in this way Stevens got several bad
hurts. Sergeant Bowers’s horse was very large
and tall, with slim, long legs, and looked like
a railroad bridge. His size enabled him to
reach all about, and as far as he wanted to,
with his head; so he was always biting Bowers’s
legs. On the march, in the sun, Bowers
slept a good deal; and as soon as the horse
recognized that he was asleep he would reach
around and bite him on the leg. His legs were
black and blue with bites. This was the only
thing that could ever make him swear, but this
always did; whenever the horse bit him he
always swore, and of course Stevens, who
laughed at everything, laughed at this, and
would even get into such convulsions over it
as to lose his balance and fall off his horse;
and then Bowers, already irritated by the pain
of the horse-bite, would resent the laughter
with hard language, and there would be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>quarrel; so that horse made no end of trouble
and bad blood in the command.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, I will get back to where I was—our
first afternoon in the sugar camp. The
sugar-troughs came very handy as horse-troughs,
and we had plenty of corn to fill them
with. I ordered Sergeant Bowers to feed my
mule; but he said that if I reckoned he went
to war to be dry-nurse to a mule, it wouldn’t
take me very long to find out my mistake. I
believed that this was insubordination, but I
was full of uncertainties about everything military,
and so I let the thing pass, and went and
ordered Smith, the blacksmith’s apprentice, to
feed the mule; but he merely gave me a large,
cold, sarcastic grin, such as an ostensibly
seven-year-old horse gives you when you lift
his lip and find he is fourteen, and turned his
back on me. I then went to the captain, and
asked if it was not right and proper and military
for me to have an orderly. He said it
was, but as there was only one orderly in the
corps, it was but right that he himself should
have Bowers on his staff. Bowers said he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>wouldn’t serve on anybody’s staff; and if anybody
thought he could make him, let him try
it. So, of course, the thing had to be dropped;
there was no other way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next, nobody would cook; it was considered
a degradation; so we had no dinner.
We lazied the rest of the pleasant afternoon
away, some dozing under the trees, some
smoking cob-pipes and talking sweethearts
and war, some playing games. By late supper-time
all hands were famished; and to meet
the difficulty all hands turned to, on an equal
footing, and gathered wood, built fires, and
cooked the meal. Afterward everything was
smooth for a while; then trouble broke out
between the corporal and the sergeant, each
claiming to rank the other. Nobody knew
which was the higher office; so Lyman had to
settle the matter by making the rank of both
officers equal. The commander of an ignorant
crew like that has many troubles and vexations
which probably do not occur in the regular
army at all. However, with the song-singing
and yarn-spinning around the camp-fire, everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>presently became serene again; and by
and by we raked the corn down level in one
end of the crib, and all went to bed on it, tying
a horse to the door, so that he would neigh if
any one tried to get in.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. It was always my impression that that was what the
horse was there for, and I know that it was also the impression
of at least one other of the command, for we talked
about it at the time, and admired the military ingenuity of
the device; but when I was out West three years ago I was
told by Mr. A. G. Fuqua, a member of our company, that
the horse was his, that the leaving him tied at the door was
a matter of mere forgetfulness, and that to attribute it to
intelligent invention was to give him quite too much credit.
In support of his position, he called my attention to the
suggestive fact that the artifice was not employed again.
I had not thought of that before.</p>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We had some horsemanship drill every
forenoon; then, afternoons, we rode off here
and there in squads a few miles, and visited
the farmers’ girls, and had a youthful good
time, and got an honest good dinner or supper,
and then home again to camp, happy and
content.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a time, life was idly delicious, it was
perfect; there was nothing to mar it. Then
came some farmers with an alarm one day.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>They said it was rumored that the enemy were
advancing in our direction, from over Hyde’s
prairie. The result was a sharp stir among us,
and general consternation. It was a rude
awakening from our pleasant trance. The
rumor was but a rumor—nothing definite about
it; so, in the confusion, we did not know which
way to retreat. Lyman was for not retreating
at all, in these uncertain circumstances; but
he found that if he tried to maintain that attitude
he would fare badly, for the command
were in no humor to put up with insubordination.
So he yielded the point and called a
council of war—to consist of himself and the
three other officers; but the privates made
such a fuss about being left out, that we had to
allow them to remain, for they were already
present, and doing the most of the talking too.
The question was, which way to retreat; but
all were so flurried that nobody seemed to
have even a guess to offer. Except Lyman.
He explained in a few calm words, that inasmuch
as the enemy were approaching from
over Hyde’s prairie, our course was simple: all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>we had to do was not to retreat <em>toward</em> him;
any other direction would answer our needs
perfectly. Everybody saw in a moment how
true this was, and how wise; so Lyman got a
great many compliments. It was now decided
that we should fall back on Mason’s farm.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was after dark by this time, and as we
could not know how soon the enemy might arrive,
it did not seem best to try to take the
horses and things with us; so we only took the
guns and ammunition, and started at once. The
route was very rough and hilly and rocky, and
presently the night grew very black and rain
began to fall; so we had a troublesome time of
it, struggling and stumbling along in the dark;
and soon some person slipped and fell, and then
the next person behind stumbled over him and
fell, and so did the rest, one after the other;
and then Bowers came with the keg of powder
in his arms, whilst the command were all mixed
together, arms and legs, on the muddy slope;
and so he fell, of course, with the keg, and this
started the whole detachment down the hill in
a body, and they landed in the brook at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>bottom in a pile, and each that was undermost
pulling the hair and scratching and biting those
that were on top of him; and those that were
being scratched and bitten, scratching and biting
the rest in their turn, and all saying they
would die before they would ever go to war
again if they ever got out of this brook this
time, and the invader might rot for all they
cared, and the country along with him—and all
such talk as that, which was dismal to hear and
take part in, in such smothered, low voices, and
such a grisly dark place and so wet, and the
enemy may be coming any moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>The keg of powder was lost, and the guns
too; so the growling and complaining continued
straight along whilst the brigade pawed
around the pasty hillside and slopped around in
the brook hunting for these things; consequently
we lost considerable time at this; and
then we heard a sound, and held our breath
and listened, and it seemed to be the enemy
coming, though it could have been a cow, for
it had a cough like a cow; but we did not wait,
but left a couple of guns behind and struck out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>for Mason’s again as briskly as we could scramble
along in the dark. But we got lost presently
among the rugged little ravines, and
wasted a deal of time finding the way again, so
it was after nine when we reached Mason’s
stile at last; and then before we could open
our mouths to give the countersign, several
dogs came bounding over the fence, with great
riot and noise, and each of them took a soldier
by the slack of his trousers and began to back
away with him. We could not shoot the dogs
without endangering the persons they were attached
to; so we had to look on, helpless, at
what was perhaps the most mortifying spectacle
of the civil war. There was light enough,
and to spare, for the Masons had now run out
on the porch with candles in their hands. The
old man and his son came and undid the dogs
without difficulty, all but Bowers’s; but they
couldn’t undo his dog, they didn’t know his
combination; he was of the bull kind, and
seemed to be set with a Yale time-lock; but
they got him loose at last with some scalding
water, of which Bowers got his share and returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>thanks. Peterson Dunlap afterwards
made up a fine name for this engagement, and
also for the night march which preceded it, but
both have long ago faded out of my memory.</p>

<p class='c013'>We now went into the house, and they began
to ask us a world of questions, whereby it
presently came out that we did not know anything
concerning who or what we were running
from; so the old gentleman made himself
very frank, and said we were a curious
breed of soldiers, and guessed we could be depended
on to end up the war in time, because
no government could stand the expense of the
shoe-leather we should cost it trying to follow
us around. “Marion <em>Rangers</em>! good name,
b’gosh!” said he. And wanted to know why
we hadn’t had a picket-guard at the place where
the road entered the prairie, and why we hadn’t
sent out a scouting party to spy out the enemy
and bring us an account of his strength, and so
on, before jumping up and stampeding out of
a strong position upon a mere vague rumor—and
so on, and so forth, till he made us all feel
shabbier than the dogs had done, not half so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>enthusiastically welcome. So we went to
bed shamed and low-spirited; except Stevens.
Soon Stevens began to devise a garment for
Bowers which could be made to automatically
display his battle-scars to the grateful, or conceal
them from the envious, according to his
occasions; but Bowers was in no humor for
this, so there was a fight, and when it was over
Stevens had some battle-scars of his own to
think about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then we got a little sleep. But after all we
had gone through, our activities were not over
for the night; for about two o’clock in the
morning we heard a shout of warning from
down the lane, accompanied by a chorus from
all the dogs, and in a moment everybody was
up and flying around to find out what the alarm
was about. The alarmist was a horseman
who gave notice that a detachment of Union
soldiers was on its way from Hannibal with orders
to capture and hang any bands like ours
which it could find, and said we had no time to
lose. Farmer Mason was in a flurry this time,
himself. He hurried us out of the house with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>all haste, and sent one of his negroes with us
to show us where to hide ourselves and our
tell-tale guns among the ravines half a mile
away. It was raining heavily.</p>

<p class='c013'>We struck down the lane, then across some
rocky pasture-land which offered good advantages
for stumbling; consequently we were
down in the mud most of the time, and every
time a man went down he blackguarded the
war, and the people that started it, and everybody
connected with it, and gave himself the
master dose of all for being so foolish as to go
into it. At last we reached the wooded mouth
of a ravine, and there we huddled ourselves
under the streaming trees, and sent the negro
back home. It was a dismal and heart-breaking
time. We were like to be drowned with the
rain, deafened with the howling wind and the
booming thunder, and blinded by the lightning.
It was indeed a wild night. The drenching
we were getting was misery enough, but a
deeper misery still was the reflection that the
halter might end us before we were a day older.
A death of this shameful sort had not occurred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>to us as being among the possibilities of
war. It took the romance all out of the campaign,
and turned our dreams of glory into a
repulsive nightmare. As for doubting that so
barbarous an order had been given, not one of
us did that.</p>

<p class='c013'>The long night wore itself out at last, and
then the negro came to us with the news that
the alarm had manifestly been a false one, and
that breakfast would soon be ready. Straightway
we were light-hearted again, and the
world was bright, and life as full of hope and
promise as ever—for we were young then.
How long ago that was! Twenty-four
years.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mongrel child of philology named the
night’s refuge Camp Devastation, and no soul
objected. The Masons gave us a Missouri
country breakfast, in Missourian abundance,
and we needed it: hot biscuits; hot “wheat
bread” prettily criss-crossed in a lattice pattern
on top; hot corn pone; fried chicken;
bacon, coffee, eggs, milk, buttermilk, etc.;—and
the world may be confidently challenged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to furnish the equal to such a breakfast, as it is
cooked in the South.</p>

<p class='c013'>We staid several days at Mason’s; and after
all these years the memory of the dulness, the
stillness and lifelessness of that slumberous
farm-house still oppresses my spirit as with a
sense of the presence of death and mourning.
There was nothing to do, nothing to think
about; there was no interest in life. The male
part of the household were away in the fields
all day, the women were busy and out of our
sight; there was no sound but the plaintive
wailing of a spinning-wheel, forever moaning
out from some distant room,—the most lonesome
sound in nature, a sound steeped and
sodden with homesickness and the emptiness
of life. The family went to bed about dark
every night, and as we were not invited to intrude
any new customs, we naturally followed
theirs. Those nights were a hundred years
long to youths accustomed to being up till
twelve. We lay awake and miserable till that
hour every time, and grew old and decrepit
waiting through the still eternities for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>clock-strikes. This was no place for town
boys. So at last it was with something very
like joy that we received news that the enemy
were on our track again. With a new birth of
the old warrior spirit, we sprang to our places
in line of battle and fell back on Camp Ralls.</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain Lyman had taken a hint from Mason’s
talk, and he now gave orders that our
camp should be guarded against surprise by
the posting of pickets. I was ordered to place
a picket at the forks of the road in Hyde’s
prairie. Night shut down black and threatening.
I told Sergeant Bowers to go out to that
place and stay till midnight; and, just as I was
expecting, he said he wouldn’t do it. I tried
to get others to go, but all refused. Some
excused themselves on account of the weather;
but the rest were frank enough to say they
wouldn’t go in any kind of weather. This
kind of thing sounds odd now, and impossible,
but there was no surprise in it at the time.
On the contrary, it seemed a perfectly natural
thing to do. There were scores of little camps
scattered over Missouri where the same thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>was happening. These camps were composed
of young men who had been born and reared
to a sturdy independence, and who did not
know what it meant to be ordered around by
Tom, Dick, and Harry, whom they had known
familiarly all their lives, in the village or on the
farm. It is quite within the probabilities that
this same thing was happening all over the
South. James Redpath recognized the justice
of this assumption, and furnished the following
instance in support of it. During a short stay
in East Tennessee he was in a citizen colonel’s
tent one day, talking, when a big private appeared
at the door, and without salute or other
circumlocution said to the colonel,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, Jim, I’m a-goin’ home for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I hain’t b’en there for a right smart
while, and I’d like to see how things is comin’
on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long are you going to be gone?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Bout two weeks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, don’t be gone longer than that; and
get back sooner if you can.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>That was all, and the citizen officer resumed
his conversation where the private had broken
it off. This was in the first months of the war,
of course. The camps in our part of Missouri
were under Brigadier-General Thomas H.
Harris. He was a townsman of ours, a first-rate
fellow, and well liked; but we had all
familiarly known him as the sole and modest-salaried
operator in our telegraph office, where
he had to send about one despatch a week in
ordinary times, and two when there was a
rush of business; consequently, when he appeared
in our midst one day, on the wing, and
delivered a military command of some sort, in
a large military fashion, nobody was surprised
at the response which he got from the assembled
soldiery,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, now, what’ll you take to <em>don’t</em>, Tom
Harris!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was quite the natural thing. One might
justly imagine that we were hopeless material
for war. And so we seemed, in our ignorant
state; but there were those among us who
afterward learned the grim trade; learned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>obey like machines; became valuable soldiers;
fought all through the war, and came out at
the end with excellent records. One of the
very boys who refused to go out on picket
duty that night, and called me an ass for thinking
he would expose himself to danger in such
a foolhardy way, had become distinguished for
intrepidity before he was a year older.</p>

<p class='c013'>I did secure my picket that night—not by
authority, but by diplomacy. I got Bowers to
go, by agreeing to exchange ranks with him
for the time being, and go along and stand the
watch with him as his subordinate. We staid
out there a couple of dreary hours in the pitchy
darkness and the rain, with nothing to modify
the dreariness but Bowers’s monotonous
growlings at the war and the weather; then
we began to nod, and presently found it next
to impossible to stay in the saddle; so we
gave up the tedious job, and went back to the
camp without waiting for the relief guard. We
rode into camp without interruption or objection
from anybody, and the enemy could have
done the same, for there were no sentries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Everybody was asleep; at midnight there was
nobody to send out another picket, so none
was sent. We never tried to establish a watch
at night again, as far as I remember, but we
generally kept a picket out in the daytime.</p>

<p class='c013'>In that camp the whole command slept on
the corn in the big corn-crib; and there was
usually a general row before morning, for the
place was full of rats, and they would scramble
over the boys’ bodies and faces, annoying and
irritating everybody; and now and then they
would bite some one’s toe, and the person
who owned the toe would start up and magnify
his English and begin to throw corn in
the dark. The ears were half as heavy as
bricks, and when they struck they hurt. The
persons struck would respond, and inside of
five minutes every man would be locked in a
death-grip with his neighbor. There was a
grievous deal of blood shed in the corn-crib,
but this was all that was spilt while I was in
the war. No, that is not quite true. But for
one circumstance it would have been all. I
will come to that now.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Our scares were frequent. Every few days
rumors would come that the enemy were approaching.
In these cases we always fell back
on some other camp of ours; we never staid
where we were. But the rumors always turned
out to be false; so at last even we began to
grow indifferent to them. One night a negro
was sent to our corn-crib with the same old
warning: the enemy was hovering in our
neighborhood. We all said let him hover.
We resolved to stay still and be comfortable.
It was a fine warlike resolution, and no doubt
we all felt the stir of it in our veins—for a moment.
We had been having a very jolly time,
that was full of horse-play and school-boy
hilarity; but that cooled down now, and presently
the fast-waning fire of forced jokes and
forced laughs died out altogether, and the
company became silent. Silent and nervous.
And soon uneasy—worried—apprehensive.
We had said we would stay, and we were committed.
We could have been persuaded to go,
but there was nobody brave enough to suggest
it. An almost noiseless movement presently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>began in the dark, by a general but unvoiced
impulse. When the movement was
completed, each man knew that he was not
the only person who had crept to the front
wall and had his eye at a crack between the
logs. No, we were all there; all there with
our hearts in our throats, and staring out
toward the sugar-troughs where the forest
foot-path came through. It was late, and
was a deep woodsy stillness everywhere.
There was a veiled moonlight, which was only
just strong enough to enable us to mark the
general shape of objects. Presently a muffled
sound caught our ears, and we recognized it
as the hoof-beats of a horse or horses. And
right away a figure appeared in the forest path;
it could have been made of smoke, its mass
had so little sharpness of outline. It was a
man on horseback; and it seemed to me that
there were others behind him. I got hold of a
gun in the dark, and pushed it through a crack
between the logs, hardly knowing what I was
doing, I was so dazed with fright. Somebody
said “Fire!” I pulled the trigger. I seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>to see a hundred flashes and hear a hundred
reports, then I saw the man fall down out of
the saddle. My first feeling was of surprised
gratification; my first impulse was an apprentice-sportsman’s
impulse to run and pick up
his game. Somebody said, hardly audibly,
“Good—we’ve got him!—wait for the rest.”
But the rest did not come. We waited—listened—still
no more came. There was not
a sound, not the whisper of a leaf; just perfect
stillness; an uncanny kind of stillness,
which was all the more uncanny on account
of the damp, earthy, late-night smells now rising
and pervading it. Then, wondering, we
crept stealthily out, and approached the man.
When we got to him the moon revealed him
distinctly. He was lying on his back, with
his arms abroad; his mouth was open and his
chest heaving with long gasps, and his white
shirt-front was all splashed with blood. The
thought shot through me that I was a murderer;
that I had killed a man—a man who
had never done me any harm. That was the
coldest sensation that ever went through my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>marrow. I was down by him in a moment,
helplessly stroking his forehead; and I would
have given anything then—my own life freely—to
make him again what he had been five
minutes before. And all the boys seemed to
be feeling in the same way; they hung over
him, full of pitying interest, and tried all they
could to help him, and said all sorts of regretful
things. They had forgotten all about
the enemy; they thought only of this one
forlorn unit of the foe. Once my imagination
persuaded me that the dying man gave
me a reproachful look out of his shadowy eyes,
and it seemed to me that I could rather he had
stabbed me than done that. He muttered and
mumbled like a dreamer in his sleep, about
his wife and his child; and I thought with a
new despair, “This thing that I have done
does not end with him; it falls upon <em>them</em> too,
and they never did me any harm, any more
than he.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a little while the man was dead. He was
killed in war; killed in fair and legitimate war;
killed in battle, as you may say; and yet he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>was as sincerely mourned by the opposing
force as if he had been their brother. The
boys stood there a half hour sorrowing over
him, and recalling the details of the tragedy,
and wondering who he might be, and if he
were a spy, and saying that if it were to do
over again they would not hurt him unless he
attacked them first. It soon came out that
mine was not the only shot fired; there were
five others,—a division of the guilt which was
a grateful relief to me, since it in some degree
lightened and diminished the burden I was
carrying. There were six shots fired at once;
but I was not in my right mind at the time,
and my heated imagination had magnified my
one shot into a volley.</p>

<p class='c013'>The man was not in uniform, and was not
armed. He was a stranger in the country;
that was all we ever found out about him.
The thought of him got to preying upon me
every night; I could not get rid of it. I could
not drive it away, the taking of that unoffending
life seemed such a wanton thing. And it
seemed an epitome of war; that all war must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>be just that—the killing of strangers against
whom you feel no personal animosity; strangers
whom, in other circumstances, you would
help if you found them in trouble, and who
would help you if you needed it. My campaign
was spoiled. It seemed to me that I
was not rightly equipped for this awful business;
that war was intended for men, and I
for a child’s nurse. I resolved to retire from
this avocation of sham soldiership while I
could save some remnant of my self-respect.
These morbid thoughts clung to me against
reason; for at bottom I did not believe I had
touched that man. The law of probabilities
decreed me guiltless of his blood; for in all
my small experience with guns I had never
hit anything I had tried to hit, and I knew I
had done my best to hit him. Yet there was
no solace in the thought. Against a diseased
imagination, demonstration goes for nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rest of my war experience was of a
piece with what I have already told of it. We
kept monotonously falling back upon one
camp or another, and eating up the country.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>I marvel now at the patience of the farmers
and their families. They ought to have shot
us; on the contrary, they were as hospitably
kind and courteous to us as if we had deserved
it. In one of these camps we found Ab
Grimes, an Upper Mississippi pilot, who afterwards
became famous as a dare-devil rebel
spy, whose career bristled with desperate adventures.
The look and style of his comrades
suggested that they had not come into the war
to play, and their deeds made good the conjecture
later. They were fine horsemen and
good revolver-shots; but their favorite arm
was the lasso. Each had one at his pommel,
and could snatch a man out of the saddle with
it every time, on a full gallop, at any reasonable
distance.</p>

<p class='c013'>In another camp the chief was a fierce and
profane old blacksmith of sixty, and he had
furnished his twenty recruits with gigantic
home-made bowie-knives, to be swung with
the two hands, like the <em>machetes</em> of the Isthmus.
It was a grisly spectacle to see that
earnest band practicing their murderous cuts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and slashes under the eye of that remorseless
old fanatic.</p>

<p class='c013'>The last camp which we fell back upon was
in a hollow near the village of Florida, where
I was born—in Monroe County. Here we
were warned, one day, that a Union colonel
was sweeping down on us with a whole regiment
at his heels. This looked decidedly serious.
Our boys went apart and consulted;
then we went back and told the other companies
present that the war was a disappointment
to us and we were going to disband.
They were getting ready, themselves, to fall
back on some place or other, and were only
waiting for General Tom Harris, who was expected
to arrive at any moment; so they tried
to persuade us to wait a little while, but the
majority of us said no, we were accustomed to
falling back, and didn’t need any of Tom Harris’s
help; we could get along perfectly well
without him—and save time too. So about
half of our fifteen, including myself, mounted
and left on the instant; the others yielded to
persuasion and staid—staid through the war.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>An hour later we met General Harris on the
road, with two or three people in his company—his
staff, probably, but we could not tell;
none of them were in uniform; uniforms had
not come into vogue among us yet. Harris
ordered us back; but we told him there was a
Union colonel coming with a whole regiment
in his wake, and it looked as if there was going
to be a disturbance; so we had concluded
to go home. He raged a little, but it was of
no use; our minds were made up. We had
done our share; had killed one man, exterminated
one army, such as it was; let him go
and kill the rest, and that would end the war.
I did not see that brisk young general again
until last year; then he was wearing white hair
and whiskers.</p>

<p class='c013'>In time I came to know that Union colonel
whose coming frightened me out of the war
and crippled the Southern cause to that extent—General
Grant. I came within a few hours
of seeing him when he was as unknown as I
was myself; at a time when anybody could
have said, “Grant?—Ulysses S. Grant? I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>not remember hearing the name before.” It
seems difficult to realize that there was once a
time when such a remark could be rationally
made; but there <em>was</em>, and I was within a few
miles of the place and the occasion too, though
proceeding in the other direction.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thoughtful will not throw this war-paper
of mine lightly aside as being valueless.
It has this value: it is a not unfair picture of
what went on in many and many a militia
camp in the first months of the rebellion, when
the green recruits were without discipline,
without the steadying and heartening influence
of trained leaders; when all their circumstances
were new and strange, and charged
with exaggerated terrors, and before the invaluable
experience of actual collision in the
field had turned them from rabbits into soldiers.
If this side of the picture of that early day has
not before been put into history, then history
has been to that degree incomplete, for it had
and has its rightful place there. There was
more Bull Run material scattered through the
early camps of this country than exhibited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>itself at Bull Run. And yet it learned its
trade presently, and helped to fight the great
battles later. I could have become a soldier
myself, if I had waited. I had got part of it
learned; I knew more about retreating than
the man that invented retreating.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>THE INVALID’S STORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>I seem sixty and married, but these effects
are due to my condition and sufferings,
for I am a bachelor, and only forty-one. It
will be hard for you to believe that I, who am
now but a shadow, was a hale, hearty man two
short years ago,—a man of iron, a very athlete!—yet
such is the simple truth. But stranger
still than this fact is the way in which I lost
my health. I lost it through helping to take
care of a box of guns on a two-hundred-mile
railway journey one winter’s night. It is the
actual truth, and I will tell you about it.</p>

<p class='c013'>I belong in Cleveland, Ohio. One winter’s
night, two years ago, I reached home just after
dark, in a driving snow-storm, and the first
thing I heard when I entered the house was
that my dearest boyhood friend and schoolmate,
John B. Hackett, had died the day before,
and that his last utterance had been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>desire that I would take his remains home to
his poor old father and mother in Wisconsin.
I was greatly shocked and grieved, but there
was no time to waste in emotions; I must start
at once. I took the card, marked “Deacon
Levi Hackett, Bethlehem, Wisconsin,” and
hurried off through the whistling storm to the
railway station. Arrived there I found the
long white-pine box which had been described
to me; I fastened the card to it with some
tacks, saw it put safely aboard the express car,
and then ran into the eating-room to provide
myself with a sandwich and some cigars.
When I returned, presently, there was my
coffin-box <em>back again</em>, apparently, and a young
fellow examining around it, with a card in his
hand, and some tacks and a hammer! I was
astonished and puzzled. He began to nail on
his card, and I rushed out to the express car,
in a good deal of a state of mind, to ask for an
explanation. But no—there was my box, all
right, in the express car; it hadn’t been disturbed.
[The fact is that without my suspecting
it a prodigious mistake had been made. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>was carrying off a box of <em>guns</em> which that
young fellow had come to the station to ship
to a rifle company in Peoria, Illinois, and <em>he</em>
had got my corpse!] Just then the conductor
sung out “All aboard,” and I jumped into the
express car and got a comfortable seat on a
bale of buckets. The expressman was there,
hard at work,—a plain man of fifty, with a
simple, honest, good-natured face, and a
breezy, practical heartiness in his general style.
As the train moved off a stranger skipped into
the car and set a package of peculiarly mature
and capable Limburger cheese on one end of
my coffin-box—I mean my box of guns. That
is to say, I know <em>now</em> that it was Limburger
cheese, but at that time I never had heard of
the article in my life, and of course was wholly
ignorant of its character. Well, we sped
through the wild night, the bitter storm raged
on, a cheerless misery stole over me, my heart
went down, down, down! The old expressman
made a brisk remark or two about the
tempest and the arctic weather, slammed his
sliding doors to, and bolted them, closed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>window down tight, and then went bustling
around, here and there and yonder, setting
things to rights, and all the time contentedly
humming “Sweet By and By,” in a low tone,
and flatting a good deal. Presently I began
to detect a most evil and searching odor stealing
about on the frozen air. This depressed my
spirits still more, because of course I attributed
it to my poor departed friend. There was
something infinitely saddening about his calling
himself to my remembrance in this dumb
pathetic way, so it was hard to keep the tears
back. Moreover, it distressed me on account
of the old expressman, who, I was afraid,
might notice it. However, he went humming
tranquilly on, and gave no sign; and for this
I was grateful. Grateful, yes, but still uneasy;
and soon I began to feel more and more uneasy
every minute, for every minute that went
by that odor thickened up the more, and got to
be more and more gamy and hard to stand.
Presently, having got things arranged to his
satisfaction, the expressman got some wood
and made up a tremendous fire in his stove.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>This distressed me more than I can tell, for I
could not but feel that it was a mistake. I was
sure that the effect would be deleterious upon
my poor departed friend. Thompson—the
expressman’s name was Thompson, as I found
out in the course of the night—now went poking
around his car, stopping up whatever stray
cracks he could find, remarking that it didn’t
make any difference what kind of a night it
was outside, he calculated to make <em>us</em> comfortable,
anyway. I said nothing, but I believed
he was not choosing the right way. Meantime
he was humming to himself just as before; and
meantime, too, the stove was getting hotter
and hotter, and the place closer and closer. I
felt myself growing pale and qualmish, but
grieved in silence and said nothing. Soon I
noticed that the “Sweet By and By” was gradually
fading out; next it ceased altogether,
and there was an ominous stillness. After a
few moments Thompson said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pfew! I reckon it ain’t no cinnamon ’t I’ve
loaded up thish-yer stove with!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He gasped once or twice, then moved toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the cof—gun-box, stood over that Limburger
cheese part of a moment, then came back and
sat down near me, looking a good deal impressed.
After a contemplative pause, he said,
indicating the box with a gesture,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Friend of yourn?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” I said with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s pretty ripe, <em>ain’t</em> he!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing further was said for perhaps a couple
of minutes, each being busy with his own
thoughts; then Thompson said, in a low, awed
voice,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sometimes it’s uncertain whether they’re
really gone or not,—<em>seem</em> gone, you know—body
warm, joints limber—and so, although
you <em>think</em> they’re gone, you don’t really know.
I’ve had cases in my car. It’s perfectly awful,
becuz <em>you</em> don’t know what minute they’ll
rise up and look at you!” Then, after a pause,
and slightly lifting his elbow toward the box,—
“But <em>he</em> ain’t in no trance! No, sir, I go bail
for <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>We sat some time, in meditative silence, listening
to the wind and the roar of the train;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>then Thompson said, with a good deal of feeling,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well-a-well, we’ve all got to go, they ain’t
no getting around it. Man that is born of woman
is of few days and far between, as Scriptur’
says. Yes, you look at it any way you
want to, it’s awful solemn and cur’us: they
ain’t <em>nobody</em> can get around it; <em>all’s</em> got to go—just
<em>everybody</em>, as you may say. One day
you’re hearty and strong”—here he scrambled
to his feet and broke a pane and stretched his
nose out at it a moment or two, then sat down
again while I struggled up and thrust my nose
out at the same place, and this we kept on doing
every now and then—“and next day he’s
cut down like the grass, and the places which
knowed him then knows him no more forever,
as Scriptur’ says. Yes’ndeedy, it’s awful solemn
and cur’us; but we’ve all got to go, one
time or another; they ain’t no getting around
it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was another long pause; then,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did he die of?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said I didn’t know.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“How long has he ben dead?”</p>

<p class='c013'>It seemed judicious to enlarge the facts to fit
the probabilities; so I said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two or three days.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But it did no good; for Thompson received
it with an injured look which plainly said,
“Two or three <em>years</em>, you mean.” Then he
went right along, placidly ignoring my statement,
and gave his views at considerable
length upon the unwisdom of putting off burials
too long. Then he lounged off toward the
box, stood a moment, then came back on a
sharp trot and visited the broken pane, observing,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Twould ’a’ ben a dum sight better, all
around, if they’d started him along last summer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thompson sat down and buried his face in
his red silk handkerchief, and began to slowly
sway and rock his body like one who is doing
his best to endure the almost unendurable. By
this time the fragrance—if you may call it fragrance—was
just about suffocating, as near as
you can come at it. Thompson’s face was turning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>gray; I knew mine hadn’t any color left in it.
By and by Thompson rested his forehead in his
left hand, with his elbow on his knee, and sort
of waved his red handkerchief towards the box
with his other hand, and said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve carried a many a one of ’em,—some of
’em considerable overdue, too,—but, lordy, he
just lays over ’em all!—and does it <em>easy</em>.
Cap., they was heliotrope to <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>This recognition of my poor friend gratified
me, in spite of the sad circumstances, because
it had so much the sound of a compliment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pretty soon it was plain that something had
got to be done. I suggested cigars. Thompson
thought it was a good idea. He said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Likely it’ll modify him some.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We puffed gingerly along for a while, and
tried hard to imagine that things were improved.
But it wasn’t any use. Before very
long, and without any consultation, both cigars
were quietly dropped from our nerveless fingers
at the same moment. Thompson said, with a
sigh,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Cap., it don’t modify him worth a cent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Fact is, it makes him worse, becuz it appears
to stir up his ambition. What do you reckon
we better do, now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I was not able to suggest anything; indeed,
I had to be swallowing and swallowing, all the
time, and did not like to trust myself to speak.
Thompson fell to maundering, in a desultory
and low-spirited way, about the miserable experiences
of this night; and he got to referring
to my poor friend by various titles,—sometimes
military ones, sometimes civil ones; and
I noticed that as fast as my poor friend’s
effectiveness grew, Thompson promoted him
accordingly,—gave him a bigger title. Finally
he said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got an idea. Suppos’n we buckle
down to it and give the Colonel a bit of a shove
towards t’other end of the car?—about ten foot,
say. He wouldn’t have so much influence,
then, don’t you reckon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said it was a good scheme. So we took in
a good fresh breath at the broken pane, calculating
to hold it till we got through; then we
went there and bent over that deadly cheese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and took a grip on the box. Thompson nodded
“All ready,” and then we threw ourselves
forward with all our might; but Thompson
slipped, and slumped down with his nose on
the cheese, and his breath got loose. He
gagged and gasped, and floundered up and
made a break for the door, pawing the air and
saying, hoarsely, “Don’t hender me!—gimme
the road! I’m a-dying; gimme the road!”
Out on the cold platform I sat down and held
his head a while, and he revived. Presently he
said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you reckon we started the Gen’rul
any?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said no; we hadn’t budged him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, then, <em>that</em> idea’s up the flume. We
got to think up something else. He’s suited
wher’ he is, I reckon; and if that’s the way he
feels about it, and has made up his mind that
he don’t wish to be disturbed, you bet he’s
a-going to have his own way in the business.
Yes, better leave him right wher’ he is, long as
he wants it so; becuz he holds all the trumps,
don’t you know, and so it stands to reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>that the man that lays out to alter his plans
for him is going to get left.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But we couldn’t stay out there in that mad
storm; we should have frozen to death. So
we went in again and shut the door, and began
to suffer once more and take turns at the break
in the window. By and by, as we were starting
away from a station where we had stopped
a moment Thompson pranced in cheerily, and
exclaimed,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“We’re all right, now! I reckon we’ve got
the Commodore this time. I judge I’ve got the
stuff here that’ll take the tuck out of him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was carbolic acid. He had a carboy of it.
He sprinkled it all around everywhere; in fact
he drenched everything with it, rifle-box,
cheese and all. Then we sat down, feeling
pretty hopeful. But it wasn’t for long. You
see the two perfumes began to mix, and then—well,
pretty soon we made a break for the
door; and out there Thompson swabbed his
face with his bandanna and said in a kind of
disheartened way,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“It ain’t no use. We can’t buck agin <em>him</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>He just utilizes everything we put up to modify
him with, and gives it his own flavor and plays
it back on us. Why, Cap., don’t you know, it’s
as much as a hundred times worse in there now
than it was when he first got a-going. I never
<em>did</em> see one of ’em warm up to his work so, and
take such a dumnation interest in it. No, sir,
I never did, as long as I’ve ben on the road;
and I’ve carried a many a one of ’em, as I was
telling you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We went in again, after we were frozen
pretty stiff; but my, we couldn’t <em>stay</em> in, now.
So we just waltzed back and forth, freezing,
and thawing, and stifling, by turns. In about
an hour we stopped at another station; and as
we left it Thompson came in with a bag, and
said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cap., I’m a-going to chance him once
more,—just this once; and if we don’t fetch him
this time, the thing for us to do, is to just throw
up the sponge and withdraw from the canvass.
That’s the way <em>I</em> put it up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had brought a lot of chicken feathers,
and dried apples, and leaf tobacco, and rags,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and old shoes, and sulphur, and assafœtida,
and one thing or another; and he piled them
on a breadth of sheet iron in the middle of the
floor, and set fire to them. When they got
well started, I couldn’t see, myself, how even
the corpse could stand it. All that went before
was just simply poetry to that smell,—but
mind you, the original smell stood up out of it
just as sublime as ever,—fact is, these other
smells just seemed to give it a better hold;
and my, how rich it was! I didn’t make these
reflections there—there wasn’t time—made
them on the platform. And breaking for the
platform, Thompson got suffocated and fell;
and before I got him dragged out, which I did
by the collar, I was mighty near gone myself.
When we revived, Thompson said dejectedly,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“We got to stay out here, Cap. We got to
do it. They ain’t no other way. The Governor
wants to travel alone, and he’s fixed so he
can outvote us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And presently he added,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“And don’t you know, we’re <em>pisoned</em>. It’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span><em>our</em> last trip, you can make up your mind to it.
Typhoid fever is what’s going to come of this.
I feel it a-coming right now. Yes, sir, we’re
elected, just as sure as you’re born.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We were taken from the platform an hour
later, frozen and insensible, at the next station,
and I went straight off into a virulent fever,
and never knew anything again for three weeks.
I found out, then, that I had spent that awful
night with a harmless box of rifles and a lot of
innocent cheese; but the news was too late to
save <em>me</em>; imagination had done its work, and
my health was permanently shattered; neither
Bermuda nor any other land can ever bring it
back to me. This is my last trip; I am on my
way home to die.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>LUCK.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>It was at a banquet in London in honor of
one of the two or three conspicuously illustrious
English military names of this generation.
For reasons which will presently appear,
I will withhold his real name and titles,
and call him Lieutenant-General Lord Arthur
Scoresby, Y.C., K.C.B., etc., etc., etc. What a
fascination there is in a renowned name! There
sat the man, in actual flesh, whom I had heard
of so many thousands of times since that day,
thirty years before, when his name shot suddenly
to the zenith from a Crimean battle-field,
to remain forever celebrated. It was food and
drink to me to look, and look, and look at that
demigod; scanning, searching, noting: the
quietness, the reserve, the noble gravity of his
countenance; the simple honesty that expressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>itself all over him; the sweet unconsciousness
of his greatness—unconsciousness of
the hundreds of admiring eyes fastened upon
him, unconsciousness of the deep, loving,
sincere worship welling out of the breasts of
those people and flowing toward him.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. [<span class='sc'>Note.</span>—This is not a fancy sketch. I got it from a
clergyman who was an instructor at Woolwich forty years
ago, and who vouched for its truth.—M. T.]</p>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The clergyman at my left was an old acquaintance
of mine—clergyman now, but had
spent the first half of his life in the camp and
field, and as an instructor in the military
school at Woolwich. Just at the moment I
have been talking about, a veiled and singular
light glimmered in his eyes, and he leaned
down and muttered confidentially to me—indicating
the hero of the banquet with a gesture,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Privately—he’s an absolute fool.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This verdict was a great surprise to me. If
its subject had been Napoleon, or Socrates, or
Solomon, my astonishment could not have
been greater. Two things I was well aware
of: that the Reverend was a man of strict
veracity, and that his judgment of men was
good. Therefore I knew, beyond doubt or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>question, that the world was mistaken about
this hero: he <em>was</em> a fool. So I meant to find
out, at a convenient moment, how the Reverend,
all solitary and alone, had discovered
the secret.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some days later the opportunity came, and
this is what the Reverend told me:</p>

<p class='c013'>About forty years ago I was an instructor in
the military academy at Woolwich. I was
present in one of the sections when young
Scoresby underwent his preliminary examination.
I was touched to the quick with pity;
for the rest of the class answered up brightly
and handsomely, while he—why, dear me, he
didn’t know <em>anything</em>, so to speak. He was
evidently good, and sweet, and lovable, and
guileless; and so it was exceedingly painful to
see him stand there, as serene as a graven
image, and deliver himself of answers which
were veritably miraculous for stupidity and
ignorance. All the compassion in me was
aroused in his behalf. I said to myself, when
he comes to be examined again, he will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>flung over, of course; so it will be simply a
harmless act of charity to ease his fall as much
as I can. I took him aside, and found that he
knew a little of Cæsar’s history; and as he
didn’t know anything else, I went to work and
drilled him like a galley-slave on a certain line
of stock questions concerning Cæsar which I
knew would be used. If you’ll believe me, he
went through with flying colors on examination
day! He went through on that purely
superficial “cram,” and got compliments too,
while others, who knew a thousand times more
than he, got plucked. By some strangely
lucky accident—an accident not likely to happen
twice in a century—he was asked no question
outside of the narrow limits of his drill.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was stupefying. Well, all through his
course I stood by him, with something of the
sentiment which a mother feels for a crippled
child; and he always saved himself—just by
miracle, apparently.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now of course the thing that would expose
him and kill him at last was mathematics. I
resolved to make his death as easy as I could;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>so I drilled him and crammed him, and crammed
him and drilled him, just on the line of
questions which the examiners would be most
likely to use, and then launched him on his
fate. Well, sir, try to conceive of the result:
to my consternation, he took the first prize!
And with it he got a perfect ovation in the
way of compliments.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sleep? There was no more sleep for me for
a week. My conscience tortured me day and
night. What I had done I had done purely
through charity, and only to ease the poor
youth’s fall—I never had dreamed of any such
preposterous result as the thing that had happened.
I felt as guilty and miserable as the
creator of Frankenstein. Here was a woodenhead
whom I had put in the way of glittering
promotions and prodigious responsibilities, and
but one thing could happen: he and his responsibilities
would all go to ruin together at
the first opportunity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Crimean war had just broken out. Of
course there had to be a war, I said to myself:
we couldn’t have peace and give this donkey a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>chance to die before he is found out. I waited
for the earthquake. It came. And it made
me reel when it did come. He was actually
gazetted to a captaincy in a marching regiment!
Better men grow old and gray in the
service before they climb to a sublimity like
that. And who could ever have foreseen that
they would go and put such a load of responsibility
on such green and inadequate shoulders?
I could just barely have stood it if
they had made him a cornet; but a captain—think
of it! I thought my hair would turn
white.</p>

<p class='c013'>Consider what I did—I who so loved repose
and inaction. I said to myself, I am responsible
to the country for this, and I must go
along with him and protect the country against
him as far as I can. So I took my poor little
capital that I had saved up through years of
work and grinding economy, and went with a
sigh and bought a cornetcy in his regiment,
and away we went to the field.</p>

<p class='c013'>And there—oh dear, it was awful. Blunders?—why,
he never did anything <em>but</em> blunder.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>But, you see, nobody was in the fellow’s
secret—everybody had him focussed wrong,
and necessarily misinterpreted his performance
every time—consequently they took his idiotic
blunders for inspirations of genius; they did,
honestly! His mildest blunders were enough
to make a man in his right mind cry; and they
did make me cry—and rage and rave too,
privately. And the thing that kept me always
in a sweat of apprehension was the fact that
every fresh blunder he made increased the
lustre of his reputation! I kept saying to myself,
he’ll get so high, that when discovery
does finally come, it will be like the sun falling
out of the sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>He went right along up, from grade to grade,
over the dead bodies of his superiors, until at
last, in the hottest moment of the battle of&nbsp;**** down went our colonel, and my heart
jumped into my mouth, for Scoresby was next
in rank! Now for it, said I; we’ll all land in
Sheol in ten minutes, sure.</p>

<p class='c013'>The battle was awfully hot; the allies were
steadily giving way all over the field. Our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>regiment occupied a position that was vital; a
blunder now must be destruction. At this
crucial moment, what does this immortal fool
do but detach the regiment from its place and
order a charge over a neighboring hill where
there wasn’t a suggestion of an enemy! “There
you go!” I said to myself; “this <em>is</em> the end at
last.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And away we did go, and were over the
shoulder of the hill before the insane movement
could be discovered and stopped. And
what did we find? An entire and unsuspected
Russian army in reserve! And what happened?
We were eaten up? That is necessarily
what would have happened in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred. But no; those Russians
argued that no single regiment would
come browsing around there at such a time. It
must be the entire English army, and that the
sly Russian game was detected and blocked;
so they turned tail, and away they went, pell-mell,
over the hill and down into the field, in
wild confusion, and we after them; they themselves
broke the solid Russian centre in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>field, and tore through, and in no time there
was the most tremendous rout you ever saw,
and the defeat of the allies was turned into a
sweeping and splendid victory! Marshal Canrobert
looked on, dizzy with astonishment, admiration,
and delight; and sent right off for
Scoresby, and hugged him, and decorated him
on the field, in presence of all the armies!</p>

<p class='c013'>And what was Scoresby’s blunder that time?
Merely the mistaking his right hand for his
left—that was all. An order had come to him
to fall back and support our right; and instead,
he fell <em>forward</em> and went over the hill to the
left. But the name he won that day as a marvellous
military genius filled the world with his
glory, and that glory will never fade while history
books last.</p>

<p class='c013'>He is just as good and sweet and lovable and
unpretending as a man can be, but he doesn’t
know enough to come in when it rains. Now
that is absolutely true. He is the supremest
ass in the universe; and until half an hour ago
nobody knew it but himself and me. He has
been pursued, day by day and year by year, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>a most phenomenal and astonishing luckiness.
He has been a shining soldier in all our wars
for a generation; he has littered his whole
military life with blunders, and yet has never
committed one that didn’t make him a knight
or a baronet or a lord or something. Look at
his breast; why, he is just clothed in domestic
and foreign decorations. Well, sir, every one
of them is the record of some shouting stupidity
or other; and taken together, they are proof
that the very best thing in all this world that
can befall a man is to be born lucky. I say
again, as I said at the banquet, Scoresby’s an
absolute fool.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>THE CAPTAIN’S STORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>There was a good deal of pleasant gossip
about old Captain “Hurricane” Jones, of
the Pacific Ocean,—peace to his ashes! Two
or three of us present had known him; I, particularly
well, for I had made four sea-voyages
with him. He was a very remarkable man.
He was born on a ship; he picked up what
little education he had among his shipmates;
he began life in the forecastle, and climbed
grade by grade to the captaincy. More than
fifty years of his sixty-five were spent at sea.
He had sailed all oceans, seen all lands, and
borrowed a tint from all climates. When a
man has been fifty years at sea, he necessarily
knows nothing of men, nothing of the world
but its surface, nothing of the world’s thought,
nothing of the world’s learning but its A B C,
and that blurred and distorted by the unfocussed
lenses of an untrained mind. Such a man is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>only a gray and bearded child. That is what
old Hurricane Jones was,—simply an innocent,
lovable old infant. When his spirit was in repose
he was as sweet and gentle as a girl; when
his wrath was up he was a hurricane that made
his nickname seem tamely descriptive. He
was formidable in a fight, for he was of powerful
build and dauntless courage. He was frescoed
from head to heel with pictures and mottoes
tattooed in red and blue India ink. I was
with him one voyage when he got his last vacant
space tattooed; this vacant space was
around his left ankle. During three days he
stumped about the ship with his ankle bare and
swollen, and this legend gleaming red and angry
out from a clouding of India ink: “Virtue
is its own R’d.” (There was a lack of room.)
He was deeply and sincerely pious, and swore
like a fish-woman. He considered swearing
blameless, because sailors would not understand
an order unillumined by it. He was a
profound Biblical scholar,—that is, he thought
he was. He believed everything in the Bible,
but he had his own methods of arriving at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>beliefs. He was of the “advanced” school of
thinkers, and applied natural laws to the interpretation
of all miracles, somewhat on the plan
of the people who make the six days of creation
six geological epochs, and so forth. Without
being aware of it, he was a rather severe
satire on modern scientific religionists. Such a
man as I have been describing is rabidly fond
of disquisition and argument; one knows that
without being told it.</p>

<p class='c013'>One trip the captain had a clergyman on
board, but did not know he was a clergyman,
since the passenger list did not betray the fact.
He took a great liking to this Rev. Mr. Peters,
and talked with him a great deal: told him
yarns, gave him toothsome scraps of personal
history, and wove a glittering streak of profanity
through his garrulous fabric that was refreshing
to a spirit weary of the dull neutralities
of undecorated speech. One day the captain
said, “Peters, do you ever read the Bible?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well—yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I judge it ain’t often, by the way you say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>it. Now, you tackle it in dead earnest once,
and you’ll find it’ll pay. Don’t you get discouraged,
but hang right on. First, you won’t
understand it; but by and by things will begin
to clear up, and then you wouldn’t lay it down
to eat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I have heard that said.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it’s so, too. There ain’t a book that begins
with it. It lays over ’em all, Peters.
There’s some pretty tough things in it,—there
ain’t any getting around that,—but you stick
to them and think them out, and when once
you get on the inside everything’s plain as
day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The miracles, too, captain?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir! the miracles, too. Every one of
them. Now, there’s that business with the
prophets of Baal; like enough that stumped
you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I don’t know but—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Own up, now; it stumped you. Well, I
don’t wonder. You hadn’t had any experience
in ravelling such things out, and naturally it
was too many for you. Would you like to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>have me explain that thing to you, and show
you how to get at the meat of these matters?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed, I would, captain, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the captain proceeded as follows: “I’ll
do it with pleasure. First, you see, I read and
read, and thought and thought, till I got to
understand what sort of people they were in
the old Bible times, and then after that it was
clear and easy. Now, this was the way I put
it up, concerning Isaac<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and the prophets of
Baal. There was some mighty sharp men
amongst the public characters of that old ancient
day, and Isaac was one of them. Isaac
had his failings,—plenty of them, too; it ain’t
for me to apologize for Isaac; he played on the
prophets of Baal, and like enough he was justifiable,
considering the odds that was against
him. No, all I say is, ’t wa’n’t any miracle, and
that I’ll show you so’s’t you can see it yourself.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. This is the captain’s own mistake.</p>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Well, times had been getting rougher and
rougher for prophets,—that is, prophets of
Isaac’s denomination. There were four hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>and fifty prophets of Baal in the community,
and only one Presbyterian; that is, if
Isaac <em>was</em> a Presbyterian, which I reckon he
was, but it don’t say. Naturally, the prophets
of Baal took all the trade. Isaac was pretty
low-spirited, I reckon, but he was a good deal
of a man, and no doubt he went a-prophesying
around, letting on to be doing a land-office
business, but ’t wa’n’t any use; he couldn’t run
any opposition to amount to anything. By
and by things got desperate with him; he sets
his head to work and thinks it all out, and then
what does he do? Why, he begins to throw
out hints that the other parties are this and
that and t’other,—nothing very definite, may
be, but just kind of undermining their reputation
in a quiet way. This made talk, of course,
and finally got to the king. The king asked
Isaac what he meant by his talk. Says Isaac,
‘Oh, nothing particular; only, can they pray
down fire from heaven on an altar? It ain’t
much, maybe, your majesty, only can they <em>do</em>
it? That’s the idea.’ So the king was a good
deal disturbed, and he went to the prophets of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Baal, and they said, pretty airy, that if he had
an altar ready, <em>they</em> were ready; and they intimated
he better get it insured, too.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So next morning all the children of Israel
and their parents and the other people gathered
themselves together. Well, here was that
great crowd of prophets of Baal packed together
on one side, and Isaac walking up and
down all alone on the other, putting up his
job. When time was called, Isaac let on to be
comfortable and indifferent; told the other
team to take the first innings. So they went
at it, the whole four hundred and fifty, praying
around the altar, very hopeful, and doing their
level best. They prayed an hour,—two hours,—three
hours,—and so on, plumb till noon. It
wa’n’t any use; they had n’t took a trick. Of
course they felt kind of ashamed before all
those people, and well they might. Now,
what would a magnanimous man do? Keep
still, wouldn’t he? Of course. What did
Isaac do? He gravelled the prophets of
Baal every way he could think of. Says he,
‘You don’t speak up loud enough; your god’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>asleep, like enough, or may be he’s taking a
walk; you want to holler, you know,’—or
words to that effect; I don’t recollect the exact
language. Mind, I don’t apologize for Isaac;
he had his faults.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, the prophets of Baal prayed along
the best they knew how all the afternoon, and
never raised a spark. At last, about sundown,
they were all tuckered out, and they owned up
and quit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What does Isaac do, now? He steps up
and says to some friends of his, there, ‘Pour
four barrels of water on the altar!’ Everybody
was astonished; for the other side had
prayed at it dry, you know, and got whitewashed.
They poured it on. Says he, ‘Heave
on four more barrels.’ Then he says, ‘Heave
on four more.’ Twelve barrels, you see, altogether.
The water ran all over the altar, and
all down the sides, and filled up a trench
around it that would hold a couple of hogsheads,—‘measures,’
it says; I reckon it means
about a hogshead. Some of the people were
going to put on their things and go, for they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>allowed he was crazy. They didn’t know
Isaac. Isaac knelt down and began to pray:
he strung along, and strung along, about the
heathen in distant lands, and about the sister
churches, and about the state and the country
at large, and about those that’s in authority in
the government, and all the usual programme,
you know, till everybody had got tired and
gone to thinking about something else, and
then, all of a sudden, when nobody was noticing,
he outs with a match and rakes it on the
under side of his leg, and pff! up the whole
thing blazes like a house afire! Twelve barrels
of <em>water</em>? <em>Petroleum</em>, sir, <span class='fss'>PETROLEUM</span>!
that’s what it was!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Petroleum, captain?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; the country was full of it. Isaac
knew all about that. You read the Bible.
Don’t you worry about the tough places.
They ain’t tough when you come to think
them out and throw light on them. There
ain’t a thing in the Bible but what is true; all
you want is to go prayerfully to work and
cipher out how ’t was done.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>A CURIOUS EXPERIENCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>This is the story which the Major told me,
as nearly as I can recall it:—</p>

<p class='c013'>In the winter of 1862–3, I was commandant
of Fort Trumbull, at New London, Conn.
Maybe our life there was not so brisk as life at
“the front”; still it was brisk enough, in its
way—one’s brains didn’t cake together there
for lack of something to keep them stirring.
For one thing, all the Northern atmosphere at
that time was thick with mysterious rumors—rumors
to the effect that rebel spies were flitting
everywhere, and getting ready to blow up
our Northern forts, burn our hotels, send infected
clothing into our towns, and all that
sort of thing. You remember it. All this had
a tendency to keep us awake, and knock the
traditional dulness out of garrison life. Besides,
ours was a recruiting station—which is
the same as saying we hadn’t any time to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>waste in dozing, or dreaming, or fooling
around. Why, with all our watchfulness, fifty
per cent. of a day’s recruits would leak out of
our hands and give us the slip the same night.
The bounties were so prodigious that a recruit
could pay a sentinel three or four hundred dollars
to let him escape, and still have enough of
his bounty-money left to constitute a fortune
for a poor man. Yes, as I said before, our life
was not drowsy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Well, one day I was in my quarters alone,
doing some writing, when a pale and ragged
lad of fourteen or fifteen entered, made a neat
bow, and said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe recruits are received here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you please enlist me, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear me, no! You are too young, my
boy, and too small.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A disappointed look came into his face, and
quickly deepened into an expression of despondency.
He turned slowly away, as if to
go; hesitated, then faced me again, and said,
in a tone which went to my heart,—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“I have no home, and not a friend in the
world. If you <em>could</em> only enlist me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But of course the thing was out of the question,
and I said so as gently as I could. Then
I told him to sit down by the stove and warm
himself, and added,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You shall have something to eat, presently.
You are hungry?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He did not answer; he did not need to; the
gratitude in his big soft eyes was more eloquent
than any words could have been. He
sat down by the stove, and I went on writing.
Occasionally I took a furtive glance at him. I
noticed that his clothes and shoes, although
soiled and damaged, were of good style and
material. This fact was suggestive. To it I
added the facts that his voice was low and
musical; his eyes deep and melancholy; his
carriage and address gentlemanly; evidently
the poor chap was in trouble. As a result, I
was interested.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, I became absorbed in my work,
by and by, and forgot all about the boy. I
don’t know how long this lasted; but, at length,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>I happened to look up. The boy’s back was
toward me, but his face was turned in such a
way that I could see one of his cheeks—and
down that cheek a rill of noiseless tears was
flowing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“God bless my soul!” I said to myself; “I
forgot the poor rat was starving.” Then I
made amends for my brutality by saying to
him, “Come along, my lad; you shall dine
with <em>me</em>; I am alone to-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He gave me another of those grateful looks,
and a happy light broke in his face. At the
table he stood with his hand on his chair-back
until I was seated, then seated himself. I took
up my knife and fork and—well, I simply held
them, and kept still; for the boy had inclined
his head and was saying a silent grace. A
thousand hallowed memories of home and my
childhood poured in upon me, and I sighed to
think how far I had drifted from religion and
its balm for hurt minds, its comfort and solace
and support.</p>

<p class='c013'>As our meal progressed, I observed that
young Wicklow—Robert Wicklow was his full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>name—knew what to do with his napkin; and—well,
in a word, I observed that he was a
boy of good breeding; never mind the details.
He had a simple frankness, too, which won
upon me. We talked mainly about himself,
and I had no difficulty in getting his history
out of him. When he spoke of his having
been born and reared in Louisiana, I warmed
to him decidedly, for I had spent some time
down there. I knew all the “coast” region of
the Mississippi, and loved it, and had not been
long enough away from it for my interest in it
to begin to pale. The very names that fell
from his lips sounded good to me,—so good
that I steered the talk in directions that would
bring them out. Baton Rouge, Plaquemine,
Donaldsonville, Sixty-mile Point, Bonnet-Carre,
the Stock-Landing, Carrollton, the
Steamship Landing, the Steamboat Landing,
New Orleans, Tchoupitoulas Street, the Esplanade,
the Rue des Bons Enfants, the St.
Charles Hotel, the Tivoli Circle, the Shell
Road, Lake Pontchartrain; and it was particularly
delightful to me to hear once more of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“R. E. Lee,” the “Natchez,” the “Eclipse,”
the “General Quitman,” the “Duncan F.
Kenner,” and other old familiar steamboats.
It was almost as good as being back there,
these names so vividly reproduced in my mind
the look of the things they stood for. Briefly,
this was little Wicklow’s history:—</p>

<p class='c013'>When the war broke out, he and his invalid
aunt and his father were living near Baton
Rouge, on a great and rich plantation which
had been in the family for fifty years. The
father was a Union man. He was persecuted
in all sorts of ways, but clung to his principles.
At last, one night, masked men burned his
mansion down, and the family had to fly for
their lives. They were hunted from place to
place, and learned all there was to know about
poverty, hunger, and distress. The invalid
aunt found relief at last: misery and exposure
killed her; she died in an open field, like a
tramp, the rain beating upon her and the thunder
booming overhead. Not long afterward,
the father was captured by an armed band;
and while the son begged and pleaded, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>victim was strung up before his face. [At this
point a baleful light shone in the youth’s eyes,
and he said, with the manner of one who talks
to himself: “If I cannot be enlisted, no matter—I
shall find a way—I shall find a way.”] As
soon as the father was pronounced dead, the
son was told that if he was not out of that region
within twenty-four hours, it would go
hard with him. That night he crept to the
riverside and hid himself near a plantation
landing. By and by the “Duncan F. Kenner”
stopped there, and he swam out and concealed
himself in the yawl that was dragging at her
stern. Before daylight the boat reached the
Stock-Landing, and he slipped ashore. He
walked the three miles which lay between that
point and the house of an uncle of his in Good-Children
Street, in New Orleans, and then his
troubles were over for the time being. But
this uncle was a Union man, too, and before
very long he concluded that he had better
leave the South. So he and young Wicklow
slipped out of the country on board a sailing
vessel, and in due time reached New York.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>They put up at the Astor House. Young
Wicklow had a good time of it for a while,
strolling up and down Broadway, and observing
the strange Northern sights; but in the
end a change came,—and not for the better.
The uncle had been cheerful at first, but now he
began to look troubled and despondent; moreover,
he became moody and irritable; talked
of money giving out, and no way to get more,—“not
enough left for one, let alone two.”
Then, one morning, he was missing—did not
come to breakfast. The boy inquired at the
office, and was told that the uncle had paid his
bill the night before and gone away—to Boston,
the clerk believed, but was not certain.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lad was alone and friendless. He did
not know what to do, but concluded he had
better try to follow and find his uncle. He
went down to the steamboat landing; learned
that the trifle of money in his pocket would not
carry him to Boston; however, it would carry
him to New London; so he took passage for
that port, resolving to trust to Providence to
furnish him means to travel the rest of the way.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>He had now been wandering about the streets
of New London three days and nights, getting
a bite and a nap here and there for charity’s
sake. But he had given up at last; courage
and hope were both gone. If he could enlist,
nobody could be more thankful; if he could not
get in as a soldier, couldn’t he be a drummer-boy?
Ah, he would work <em>so</em> hard to please,
and would be so grateful!</p>

<p class='c013'>Well, there’s the history of young Wicklow,
just as he told it to me, barring details. I
said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My boy, you are among friends, now,—don’t
you be troubled any more.” How his
eyes glistened! I called in Sergeant John
Rayburn,—he was from Hartford; lives in
Hartford yet; maybe you know him,—and
said, “Rayburn, quarter this boy with the
musicians. I am going to enroll him as a
drummer-boy, and I want you to look after
him and see that he is well treated.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Well, of course, intercourse between the
commandant of the post and the drummer-boy
came to an end, now; but the poor little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>friendless chap lay heavy on my heart, just the
same. I kept on the lookout, hoping to see
him brighten up and begin to be cheery and
gay; but no, the days went by, and there was
no change. He associated with nobody; he
was always absent-minded, always thinking;
his face was always sad. One morning Rayburn
asked leave to speak to me privately.
Said he,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope I don’t offend, sir; but the truth is,
the musicians are in such a sweat it seems as if
somebody’s <em>got</em> to speak.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what is the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s the Wicklow boy, sir. The musicians
are down on him to an extent you can’t imagine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, go on, go on. What has he been
doing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Prayin’, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Praying!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; the musicians haven’t any peace
of their life for that boy’s prayin’. First thing
in the morning he’s at it; noons he’s at it; and
nights—well, <em>nights</em> he just lays into ’em like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>all possessed! Sleep? Bless you, they <em>can’t</em>
sleep: he’s got the floor, as the sayin’ is, and
then when he once gets his supplication-mill
a-goin’, there just simply ain’t any let-up <em>to</em>
him. He starts in with the band-master, and
he prays for him; next he takes the head
bugler, and he prays for him; next the bass
drum, and he scoops <em>him</em> in; and so on, right
straight through the band, givin’ them all a
show, and takin’ that amount of interest in it
which would make you think he thought he
warn’t but a little while for this world, and believed
he couldn’t be happy in heaven without
he had a brass band along, and wanted to pick
’em out for himself, so he could depend on ’em
to do up the national tunes in a style suitin’ to
the place. Well, sir, heavin’ boots at him don’t
have no effect; it’s dark in there; and, besides,
he don’t pray fair, anyway, but kneels down
behind the big drum; so it don’t make no difference
if they <em>rain</em> boots at him, <em>he</em> don’t give
a dern—warbles right along, same as if it was
applause. They sing out, ‘Oh, dry up!’ ‘Give
us a rest!’ ‘Shoot him!’ ‘Oh, take a walk!’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and all sorts of such things. But what of it?
It don’t phaze him. <em>He</em> don’t mind it.” After
a pause: “Kind of a good little fool, too; gits
up in the mornin’ and carts all that stock of
boots back, and sorts ’em out and sets each
man’s pair where they belong. And they’ve
been throwed at him so much now, that he
knows every boot in the band,—can sort ’em
out with his eyes shut.”</p>

<p class='c013'>After another pause, which I forebore to
interrupt,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the roughest thing about it is, that
when he’s done prayin’,—when he ever <em>does</em>
get done,—he pipes up and begins to <em>sing</em>.
Well, you know what a honey kind of a voice
he’s got when he talks; you know how it
would persuade a cast-iron dog to come down
off of a doorstep and lick his hand. Now if
you’ll take my word for it, sir, it ain’t a circumstance
to his singin’! Flute music is harsh to
that boy’s singin’. Oh, he just gurgles it out
so soft and sweet and low, there in the dark,
that it makes you think you are in heaven.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is there ‘rough’ about that?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Ah, that’s just it, sir. You hear him sing</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Just as I am—poor, wretched, blind,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>—just you hear him sing that, once, and see if
you don’t melt all up and the water come into
your eyes! I don’t care <em>what</em> he sings, it goes
plum straight home to you—it goes deep down
to where you <em>live</em>—and it fetches you every
time! Just you hear him sing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Child of sin and sorrow, filled with dismay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wait not till to-morrow, yield thee to-day;</div>
      <div class='line in12'>Grieve not that love</div>
      <div class='line in12'>Which, from above’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>and so on. It makes a body feel like the
wickedest, ungratefulest brute that walks.
And when he sings them songs of his about
home, and mother, and childhood, and old
friends dead and gone, it fetches everything
before your face that you’ve ever loved and
lost in all your life—and it’s just beautiful, it’s
just divine to listen to, sir—but, Lord, Lord,
the heart-break of it! The band—well, they
all cry—every rascal of them blubbers, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>don’t try to hide it, either; and first you know,
that very gang that’s been slammin’ boots at
that boy will skip out of their bunks all of a
sudden, and rush over in the dark and hug
him! Yes, they do—and slobber all over him,
and call him pet names, and beg him to forgive
them. And just at that time, if a regiment
was to offer to hurt a hair of that cub’s
head, they’d go for that regiment, if it was a
whole army corps!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Another pause.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is that all?” said I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, dear me, what is the complaint?
What do they want done?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Done? Why, bless you, sir, they want
you to stop him from <em>singin’</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What an idea! You said his music was
divine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s just it. It’s <em>too</em> divine. Mortal man
can’t stand it. It stirs a body up so; it turns a
body inside out; it racks his feelin’s all to
rags; it makes him feel bad and wicked, and
not fit for any place but perdition. It keeps a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>body in such an everlastin’ state of repentin’,
that nothin’ don’t taste good and there ain’t no
comfort in life. And then the <em>cryin’</em>, you see—every
mornin’ they are ashamed to look one
another in the face.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, this is an odd case, and a singular
complaint. So they really want the singing
stopped?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir, that is the idea. They don’t
wish to ask too much; they would like powerful
well to have the prayin’ shut down on, or
leastways trimmed off around the edges; but
the main thing’s the singin’. If they can only
get the singin’ choked off, they think they can
stand the prayin’, rough as it is to be bullyragged
so much that way.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I told the sergeant I would take the matter
under consideration. That night I crept into
the musicians’ quarters and listened. The
sergeant had not overstated the case. I heard
the praying voice pleading in the dark; I
heard the execrations of the harassed men; I
heard the rain of boots whiz through the air,
and bang and thump around the big drum.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The thing touched me, but it amused me, too.
By and by, after an impressive silence, came
the singing. Lord, the pathos of it, the enchantment
of it! Nothing in the world was
ever so sweet, so gracious, so tender, so holy,
so moving. I made my stay very brief; I was
beginning to experience emotions of a sort not
proper to the commandant of a fortress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next day I issued orders which stopped the
praying and singing. Then followed three or
four days which were so full of bounty-jumping
excitements and irritations that I never once
thought of my drummer-boy. But now comes
Sergeant Rayburn, one morning, and says,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“That new boy acts mighty strange, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir, he’s all the time writing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Writing? What does he write—letters?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t know, sir; but whenever he’s off
duty, he is always poking and nosing around
the fort, all by himself,—blest if I think there’s
a hole or corner in it he hasn’t been into,—and
every little while he outs with pencil and paper
and scribbles something down.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>This gave me a most unpleasant sensation.
I wanted to scoff at it, but it was not a time to
scoff at <em>anything</em> that had the least suspicious
tinge about it. Things were happening all
around us, in the North, then, that warned us to
be always on the alert, and always suspecting.
I recalled to mind the suggestive fact that this
boy was from the South,—the extreme South,
Louisiana,—and the thought was not of a reassuring
nature, under the circumstances.
Nevertheless, it cost me a pang to give the
orders which I now gave to Rayburn. I felt
like a father who plots to expose his own child
to shame and injury. I told Rayburn to keep
quiet, bide his time, and get me some of those
writings whenever he could manage it without
the boy’s finding it out. And I charged him
not to do anything which might let the boy
discover that he was being watched. I also
ordered that he allow the lad his usual liberties,
but that he be followed at a distance when
he went out into the town.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the next two days, Rayburn reported
to me several times. No success. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>boy was still writing, but he always pocketed
his paper with a careless air whenever Rayburn
appeared in his vicinity. He had gone
twice to an old deserted stable in the town,
remained a minute or two, and come out
again. One could not pooh-pooh these things—they
had an evil look. I was obliged to
confess to myself that I was getting uneasy.
I went into my private quarters and sent for
my second in command—an officer of intelligence
and judgment, son of General James
Watson Webb. He was surprised and troubled.
We had a long talk over the matter, and
came to the conclusion that it would be worth
while to institute a secret search. I determined
to take charge of that myself. So I
had myself called at two in the morning; and,
pretty soon after, I was in the musicians’ quarters,
crawling along the floor on my stomach
among the snorers. I reached my slumbering
waif’s bunk at last, without disturbing anybody,
captured his clothes and kit, and crawled
stealthily back again. When I got to my own
quarters, I found Webb there, waiting and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>eager to know the result. We made search
immediately. The clothes were a disappointment.
In the pockets we found blank paper
and a pencil; nothing else, except a jackknife
and such queer odds and ends and useless
trifles as boys hoard and value. We
turned to the kit hopefully. Nothing there
but a rebuke for us!—a little Bible with this
written on the fly-leaf: “Stranger, be kind to
my boy, for his mother’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I looked at Webb—he dropped his eyes; he
looked at me—I dropped mine. Neither spoke.
I put the book reverently back in its place.
Presently Webb got up and went away, without
remark. After a little I nerved myself up
to my unpalatable job, and took the plunder
back to where it belonged, crawling on my
stomach as before. It seemed the peculiarly
appropriate attitude for the business I was
in.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was most honestly glad when it was over
and done with.</p>

<p class='c013'>About noon next day Rayburn came, as usual,
to report. I cut him short. I said,—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Let this nonsense be dropped. We are
making a bugaboo out of a poor little cub
who has got no more harm in him than a
hymn-book.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The sergeant looked surprised, and said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, you know it was your orders, sir, and
I’ve got some of the writing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what does it amount to? How did
you get it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I peeped through the key-hole, and see
him writing. So when I judged he was about
done, I made a sort of a little cough, and I see
him crumple it up and throw it in the fire,
and look all around to see if anybody was coming.
Then he settled back as comfortable and
careless as anything. Then I comes in, and
passes the time of day pleasantly, and sends
him of an errand. He never looked uneasy,
but went right along. It was a coal-fire and
new-built; the writing had gone over behind a
chunk, out of sight; but I got it out; there it is;
it ain’t hardly scorched, you see.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I glanced at the paper and took in a sentence
or two. Then I dismissed the sergeant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>told him to send Webb to me. Here is the
paper in full:—</p>

<blockquote>
<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Fort Trumbull</span>, the 8th.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Colonel</span>,—I was mistaken as to the calibre of the
three guns I ended my list with. They are 18–pounders;
all the rest of the armament is as I stated. The
garrison remains as before reported, except that the
two light infantry companies that were to be detached
for service at the front are to stay here for the present—can’t
find out for how long, just now, but will soon.
We are satisfied that, all things considered, matters
had better be postponed un—”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c013'>There it broke off—there is where Rayburn
coughed and interrupted the writer. All my
affection for the boy, all my respect for him and
charity for his forlorn condition, withered in a
moment under the blight of this revelation of
cold-blooded baseness.</p>

<p class='c013'>But never mind about that. Here was business,—business
that required profound and immediate
attention, too. Webb and I turned
the subject over and over, and examined it all
around. Webb said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What a pity he was interrupted! Something
is going to be postponed until—when?
And what <em>is</em> the something? Possibly he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>would have mentioned it, the pious little reptile!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” I said, “we have missed a trick.
And who is ‘<em>we</em>,’ in the letter? Is it conspirators
inside the fort or outside?”</p>

<p class='c013'>That “we” was uncomfortably suggestive.
However, it was not worth while to be guessing
around that, so we proceeded to matters
more practical. In the first place, we decided
to double the sentries and keep the strictest
possible watch. Next, we thought of calling
Wicklow in and making him divulge everything;
but that did not seem wisest until other
methods should fail. We must have some more
of the writings; so we began to plan to that
end. And now we had an idea: Wicklow
never went to the post-office,—perhaps the deserted
stable was his post-office. We sent for
my confidential clerk—a young German named
Sterne, who was a sort of natural detective—and
told him all about the case and ordered
him to go to work on it. Within the hour we
got word that Wicklow was writing again.
Shortly afterward, word came that he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>asked leave to go out into the town. He was
detained awhile, and meantime Sterne hurried
off and concealed himself in the stable. By
and by he saw Wicklow saunter in, look about
him, then hide something under some rubbish
in a corner, and take leisurely leave again.
Sterne pounced upon the hidden article—a letter—and
brought it to us. It had no superscription
and no signature. It repeated what we
had already read, and then went on to say:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c013'>“We think it best to postpone till the two companies
are gone. I mean the four inside think so; have not
communicated with the others—afraid of attracting
attention. I say four because we have lost two; they
had hardly enlisted and got inside when they were
shipped off to the front. It will be absolutely necessary
to have two in their places. The two that went
were the brothers from Thirty-mile Point. I have
something of the greatest importance to reveal, but
must not trust it to this method of communication;
will try the other.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c013'>“The little scoundrel!” said Webb; “who
<em>could</em> have supposed he was a spy? However,
never mind about that; let us add up our particulars,
such as they are, and see how the case
stands to date. First, we’ve got a rebel spy in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>our midst, whom we know; secondly, we’ve
got three more in our midst whom we don’t
know; thirdly, these spies have been introduced
among us through the simple and easy
process of enlisting as soldiers in the Union
army—and evidently two of them have got
sold at it, and been shipped off to the front;
fourthly, there are assistant spies ‘outside’—number
indefinite; fifthly, Wicklow has very
important matter which he is afraid to communicate
by the ‘present method’—will ‘try the
other.’ That is the case, as it now stands.
Shall we collar Wicklow and make him confess?
Or shall we catch the person who removes
the letters from the stable and make <em>him</em>
tell? Or shall we keep still and find out
more?”</p>

<p class='c013'>We decided upon the last course. We
judged that we did not need to proceed to
summary measures now, since it was evident
that the conspirators were likely to wait till
those two light infantry companies were out of
the way. We fortified Sterne with pretty
ample powers, and told him to use his best endeavors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>to find out Wicklow’s “other method”
of communication. We meant to play a bold
game; and to this end we proposed to keep
the spies in an unsuspecting state as long as
possible. So we ordered Sterne to return to
the stable immediately, and, if he found the
coast clear, to conceal Wicklow’s letter where
it was before, and leave it there for the conspirators
to get.</p>

<p class='c013'>The night closed down without further event.
It was cold and dark and sleety, with a raw
wind blowing; still I turned out of my warm
bed several times during the night, and went
the rounds in person, to see that all was right
and that every sentry was on the alert. I always
found them wide awake and watchful;
evidently whispers of mysterious dangers had
been floating about, and the doubling of the
guards had been a kind of indorsement of those
rumors. Once, toward morning, I encountered
Webb, breasting his way against the bitter
wind, and learned then that he, also, had been
the rounds several times to see that all was
going right.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Next day’s events hurried things up somewhat.
Wicklow wrote another letter; Sterne
preceded him to the stable and saw him deposit
it; captured it as soon as Wicklow was
out of the way, then slipped out and followed
the little spy at a distance, with a detective in
plain clothes at his own heels, for we thought
it judicious to have the law’s assistance handy
in case of need. Wicklow went to the railway
station, and waited around till the train from
New York came in, then stood scanning the
faces of the crowd as they poured out of the
cars. Presently an aged gentleman, with green
goggles and a cane, came limping along, stopped
in Wicklow’s neighborhood, and began to
look about him expectantly. In an instant
Wicklow darted forward, thrust an envelope
into his hand, then glided away and disappeared
in the throng. The next instant
Sterne had snatched the letter; and as he hurried
past the detective, he said: “Follow the
old gentleman—don’t lose sight of him.” Then
Sterne skurried out with the crowd, and came
straight to the fort.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>We sat with closed doors, and instructed
the guard outside to allow no interruption.</p>

<p class='c013'>First we opened the letter captured at the
stable. It read as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Holy Alliance</span>,—Found, in the usual gun, commands
from the Master, left there last night, which set
aside the instructions heretofore received from the
subordinate quarter. Have left in the gun the usual
indication that the commands reached the proper
hand—”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c013'>Webb, interrupting: “Isn’t the boy under
constant surveillance now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said yes; he had been under strict surveillance
ever since the capturing of his former
letter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then how could he put anything into a
gun, or take anything out of it, and not get
caught?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” I said, “I don’t like the look of that
very well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t, either,” said Webb. “It simply
means that there are conspirators among the
very sentinels. Without their connivance in
some way or other, the thing couldn’t have
been done.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>I sent for Rayburn, and ordered him to
examine the batteries and see what he could
find. The reading of the letter was then resumed:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c013'>“The new commands are peremptory, and require
that the MMMM shall be FFFFF at 3 o’clock to-morrow
morning. Two hundred will arrive, in small
parties, by train and otherwise, from various directions,
and will be at appointed place at right time. I will
distribute the sign to-day. Success is apparently sure,
though something must have got out, for the sentries
have been doubled, and the chiefs went the rounds
last night several times. W. W. comes from southerly
to-day and will receive secret orders—by the other
method. All six of you must be in 166 at sharp 2 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>
You will find B. B. there, who will give you detailed
instructions. Password same as last time, only reversed—put
first syllable last and last syllable first.
<span class='sc'>Remember</span> XXXX. Do not forget. Be of good
heart; before the next sun rises you will be heroes;
your fame will be permanent; you will have added a
deathless page to history. Amen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c013'>“Thunder and Mars,” said Webb, “but we
are getting into mighty hot quarters, as I look
at it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I said there was no question but that things
were beginning to wear a most serious aspect.
Said I,—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“A desperate enterprise is on foot, that is
plain enough. To-night is the time set for it,—that,
also, is plain. The exact nature of the
enterprise—I mean the manner of it—is hidden
away under those blind bunches of M’s
and F’s, but the end and aim, I judge, is the
surprise and capture of the post. We must
move quick and sharp now. I think nothing
can be gained by continuing our clandestine
policy as regards Wicklow. We <em>must</em> know,
and as soon as possible, too, where ‘166’ is
located, so that we can make a descent upon
the gang there at 2 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>; and doubtless the
quickest way to get that information will be to
force it out of that boy. But first of all, and
before we make any important move, I must
lay the facts before the War Department, and
ask for plenary powers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The despatch was prepared in cipher to go
over the wires; I read it, approved it, and sent
it along.</p>

<p class='c013'>We presently finished discussing the letter
which was under consideration, and then
opened the one which had been snatched from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the lame gentleman. It contained nothing but
a couple of perfectly blank sheets of note-paper!
It was a chilly check to our hot eagerness
and expectancy. We felt as blank as the
paper, for a moment, and twice as foolish.
But it was for a moment only; for, of course,
we immediately afterward thought of “sympathetic
ink.” We held the paper close to the
fire and watched for the characters to come
out, under the influence of the heat; but nothing
appeared but some faint tracings, which
we could make nothing of. We then called in
the surgeon, and sent him off with orders to
apply every test he was acquainted with till he
got the right one, and report the contents of the
letter to me the instant he brought them to the
surface. This check was a confounded annoyance,
and we naturally chafed under the delay;
for we had fully expected to get out of that letter
some of the most important secrets of the plot.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now appeared Sergeant Rayburn, and drew
from his pocket a piece of twine string about a
foot long, with three knots tied in it, and held
it up.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“I got it out of a gun on the water-front,”
said he. “I took the tompions out of all the
guns and examined close; this string was the
only thing that was in any gun.”</p>

<p class='c013'>So this bit of string was Wicklow’s “sign” to
signify that the “Master’s” commands had not
miscarried. I ordered that every sentinel who
had served near that gun during the past twenty-four
hours be put in confinement at once and
separately, and not allowed to communicate
with any one without my privity and consent.</p>

<p class='c013'>A telegram now came from the Secretary of
War. It read as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c013'>“Suspend <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>. Put town under martial
law. Make necessary arrests. Act with vigor and
promptness. Keep the Department informed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c013'>We were now in shape to go to work. I
sent out and had the lame gentleman quietly
arrested and as quietly brought into the fort;
I placed him under guard, and forbade speech
to him or from him. He was inclined to bluster
at first, but he soon dropped that.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next came word that Wicklow had been
seen to give something to a couple of our new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>recruits; and that, as soon as his back was
turned, these had been seized and confined.
Upon each was found a small bit of paper,
bearing these words and signs in pencil:—</p>

<div class='box'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c020'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Eagle’s Third Flight.</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>Remember xxxx.</span></div>
    <div>166.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c013'>In accordance with instructions, I telegraphed
to the Department, in cipher, the
progress made, and also described the above
ticket. We seemed to be in a strong enough
position now to venture to throw off the mask
as regarded Wicklow; so I sent for him. I
also sent for and received back the letter written
in sympathetic ink, the surgeon accompanying
it with the information that thus far it
had resisted his tests, but that there were others
he could apply when I should be ready for
him to do so.</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Wicklow entered. He had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>somewhat worn and anxious look, but he was
composed and easy, and if he suspected anything
it did not appear in his face or manner.
I allowed him to stand there a moment or two,
then I said pleasantly,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My boy, why do you go to that old stable
so much?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He answered, with simple demeanor and
without embarrassment,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I hardly know, sir; there isn’t any
particular reason, except that I like to be
alone, and I amuse myself there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You amuse yourself there, do you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” he replied, as innocently and
simply as before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is that all you do there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” he said, looking up with childlike
wonderment in his big soft eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are <em>sure</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir, sure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>After a pause, I said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wicklow, why do you write so much?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I? I do not write much, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You don’t?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“No, sir. Oh, if you mean scribbling, I <em>do</em>
scribble some, for amusement.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you do with your scribblings?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing, sir—throw them away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never send them to anybody?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I suddenly thrust before him the letter to the
“Colonel.” He started slightly, but immediately
composed himself. A slight tinge spread
itself over his cheek.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How came you to send <em>this</em> piece of scribbling,
then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I nev—never meant any harm, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never meant any harm! You betray the
armament and condition of the post, and mean
no harm by it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He hung his head and was silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, speak up, and stop lying. Whom
was this letter intended for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He showed signs of distress, now; but quickly
collected himself, and replied, in a tone of
deep earnestness,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you the truth, sir—the whole
truth. The letter was never intended for anybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>at all. I wrote it only to amuse myself.
I see the error and foolishness of it, now,—but
it is the only offence, sir, upon my honor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, I am glad of that. It is dangerous to
be writing such letters. I hope you are sure
this is the only one you wrote?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir, perfectly sure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His hardihood was stupefying. He told that
lie with as sincere a countenance as any creature
ever wore. I waited a moment to soothe
down my rising temper, and then said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wicklow, jog your memory now, and see
if you can help me with two or three little matters
which I wish to inquire about.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will do my very best, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, to begin with—who is ‘the Master’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>It betrayed him into darting a startled
glance at our faces, but that was all. He was
serene again in a moment, and tranquilly
answered,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not know, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You do not know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“You are <em>sure</em> you do not know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He tried hard to keep his eyes on mine, but
the strain was too great; his chin sunk slowly
toward his breast and he was silent; he stood
there nervously fumbling with a button, an object
to command one’s pity, in spite of his base
acts. Presently I broke the stillness with the
question,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who are the ‘Holy Alliance’?”</p>

<p class='c013'>His body shook visibly, and he made a slight
random gesture with his hands, which to me
was like the appeal of a despairing creature for
compassion. But he made no sound. He continued
to stand with his face bent toward the
ground. As we sat gazing at him, waiting for
him to speak, we saw the big tears begin to roll
down his cheeks. But he remained silent. After
a little, I said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You must answer me, my boy, and you
must tell me the truth. Who are the Holy Alliance?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He wept on in silence. Presently I said,
somewhat sharply,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Answer the question!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>He struggled to get command of his voice;
and then, looking up appealingly, forced the
words out between his sobs,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, have pity on me, sir! I cannot answer
it, for I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed, sir, I am telling the truth. I never
have heard of the Holy Alliance till this moment.
On my honor, sir, this is so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good heavens! Look at this second
letter of yours; there, do you see those
words, ‘<em>Holy Alliance</em>?’ What do you say
now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He gazed up into my face with the hurt look
of one upon whom a great wrong had been
wrought, then said, feelingly,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is some cruel joke, sir; and how could
they play it upon me, who have tried all I
could to do right, and have never done harm
to anybody? Some one has counterfeited my
hand; I never wrote a line of this; I have
never seen this letter before!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, you unspeakable liar! Here, what do
you say to <em>this</em>?”—and I snatched the sympathetic ink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>letter from my pocket and thrust it
before his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>His face turned white!—as white as a dead
person’s. He wavered slightly in his tracks,
and put his hand against the wall to steady
himself. After a moment he asked, in so faint
a voice that it was hardly audible,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you-read it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Our faces must have answered the truth before
my lips could get out a false “yes,” for I
distinctly saw the courage come back into that
boy’s eyes. I waited for him to say something,
but he kept silent. So at last I said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what have you to say as to the revelations
in this letter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He answered, with perfect composure,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing, except that they are entirely
harmless and innocent; they can hurt nobody.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I was in something of a corner now, as I
couldn’t disprove his assertion. I did not know
exactly how to proceed. However, an idea
came to my relief, and I said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are sure you know nothing about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Master and the Holy Alliance, and did not
write the letter which you say is a forgery?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir—sure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I slowly drew out the knotted twine string
and held it up without speaking. He gazed at
it indifferently, then looked at me inquiringly.
My patience was sorely taxed. However, I
kept my temper down, and said in my usual
voice,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wicklow, do you see this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It seems to be a piece of string.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Seems?</em> It <em>is</em> a piece of string. Do you
recognize it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir,” he replied, as calmly as the words
could be uttered.</p>

<p class='c013'>His coolness was perfectly wonderful! I
paused now for several seconds, in order that
the silence might add impressiveness to what
I was about to say; then I rose and laid my
hand on his shoulder, and said gravely,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will do you no good, poor boy, none in
the world. This sign to the ‘Master,’ this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>knotted string, found in one of the guns on the
water-front—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Found <em>in</em> the gun! Oh, no, no, no! do not
say <em>in</em> the gun, but in a crack in the tompion!—it
<em>must</em> have been in the crack!” and down
he went on his knees and clasped his hands
and lifted up a face that was pitiful to see,
so ashy it was, and wild with terror.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, it was <em>in</em> the gun.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, something has gone wrong! My God,
I am lost!” and he sprang up and darted this
way and that, dodging the hands that were put
out to catch him, and doing his best to escape
from the place. But of course escape was impossible.
Then he flung himself on his knees
again, crying with all his might, and clasped
me around the legs; and so he clung to me and
begged and pleaded, saying, “Oh, have pity
on me! Oh, be merciful to me! Do not betray
me; they would not spare my life a moment!
Protect me, save me. I will confess
everything!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It took us some time to quiet him down
and modify his fright, and get him into something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>like a rational frame of mind. Then
I began to question him, he answering
humbly, with downcast eyes, and from time
to time swabbing away his constantly flowing
tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So you are at heart a rebel?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And a spy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And have been acting under distinct orders
from outside?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Willingly?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Gladly</em>, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; it would do no good to deny it.
The South is my country; my heart is Southern,
and it is all in her cause.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then the tale you told me of your wrongs
and the persecution of your family was made
up for the occasion?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They—they told me to say it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you would betray and destroy those
who pitied and sheltered you. Do you comprehend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>how base you are, you poor misguided
thing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He replied with sobs only.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, let that pass. To business. Who is
the ‘Colonel,’ and where is he?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He began to cry hard, and tried to beg off
from answering. He said he would be killed
if he told. I threatened to put him in the dark
cell and lock him up if he did not come out
with the information. At the same time I
promised to protect him from all harm if he
made a clean breast. For all answer, he closed
his mouth firmly and put on a stubborn air
which I could not bring him out of. At last I
started with him; but a single glance into the
dark cell converted him. He broke into a
passion of weeping and supplicating, and declared
he would tell everything.</p>

<p class='c013'>So I brought him back, and he named the
“Colonel,” and described him particularly.
Said he would be found at the principal hotel
in the town, in citizen’s dress. I had to
threaten him again, before he would describe
and name the “Master.” Said the Master
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>would be found at No. 15 Bond Street, New
York, passing under the name of R. F. Gaylord.
I telegraphed name and description to
the chief of police of the metropolis, and asked
that Gaylord be arrested and held till I could
send for him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now,” said I, “it seems that there are several
of the conspirators ‘outside,’ presumably
in New London. Name and describe them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He named and described three men and two
women,—all stopping at the principal hotel. I
sent out quietly, and had them and the “Colonel”
arrested and confined in the fort.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Next, I want to know all about your three
fellow-conspirators who are here in the fort.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was about to dodge me with a falsehood,
I thought; but I produced the mysterious bits
of paper which had been found upon two of
them, and this had a salutary effect upon him.
I said we had possession of two of the men, and
he must point out the third. This frightened
him badly, and he cried out,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, please don’t make me; he would kill
me on the spot!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>I said that that was all nonsense; I would
have somebody near by to protect him, and,
besides, the men should be assembled without
arms. I ordered all the raw recruits to be
mustered, and then the poor trembling little
wretch went out and stepped along down the
line, trying to look as indifferent as possible.
Finally he spoke a single word to one of the
men, and before he had gone five steps the
man was under arrest.</p>

<p class='c013'>As soon as Wicklow was with us again, I
had those three men brought in. I made one
of them stand forward, and said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, Wicklow, mind, not a shade’s divergence
from the exact truth. Who is this man,
and what do you know about him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Being “in for it,” he cast consequences aside,
fastened his eyes on the man’s face, and spoke
straight along without hesitation,—to the following
effect.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His real name is George Bristow. He is
from New Orleans; was second mate of the
coast-packet ‘Capitol,’ two years ago; is a
desperate character, and has served two terms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>for manslaughter,—one for killing a deck-hand
named Hyde with a capstan-bar, and one for
killing a roustabout for refusing to heave the
lead, which is no part of a roustabout’s business.
He is a spy, and was sent here by the
Colonel, to act in that capacity. He was third
mate of the ‘St. Nicholas,’ when she blew up
in the neighborhood of Memphis, in ’58, and
came near being lynched for robbing the dead
and wounded while they were being taken
ashore in an empty wood-boat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And so forth and so on—he gave the man’s
biography in full. When he had finished, I
said to the man,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What have you to say to this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Barring your presence, sir, it is the infernalest
lie that ever was spoke!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I sent him back into confinement, and called
the others forward in turn. Same result. The
boy gave a detailed history of each, without
ever hesitating for a word or a fact; but all I
could get out of either rascal was the indignant
assertion that it was all a lie. They would
confess nothing. I returned them to captivity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and brought out the rest of my prisoners, one
by one. Wicklow told all about them—what
towns in the South they were from, and every
detail of their connection with the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c013'>But they all denied his facts, and not one of
them confessed a thing. The men raged, the
women cried. According to their stories,
they were all innocent people from out West,
and loved the Union above all things in this
world. I locked the gang up, in disgust, and
fell to catechising Wicklow once more.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is No. 166, and who is B. B.?”</p>

<p class='c013'>But <em>there</em> he was determined to draw the
line. Neither coaxing nor threats had any
effect upon him. Time was flying—it was
necessary to institute sharp measures. So I
tied him up a-tiptoe by the thumbs. As the
pain increased, it wrung screams from him
which were almost more than I could bear.
But I held my ground, and pretty soon he
shrieked out,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, <em>please</em> let me down, and I will tell!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—you’ll tell <em>before</em> I let you down.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Every instant was agony to him, now, so out
it came,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“No. 166, Eagle Hotel!”—naming a wretched
tavern down by the water, a resort of common
laborers, ’longshoremen, and less reputable
folk.</p>

<p class='c013'>So I released him, and then demanded to
know the object of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To take the fort to-night,” said he, doggedly
and sobbing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have I got all the chiefs of the conspiracy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No. You’ve got all except those that are
to meet at 166.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What does ‘Remember XXXX’ mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>No reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the password to No. 166?”</p>

<p class='c013'>No reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do those bunches of letters mean,—‘FFFFF’
and ‘MMMM’? Answer! or you
will catch it again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never <em>will</em> answer! I will die first. Now
do what you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Think what you are saying, Wicklow. Is
it final?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>He answered steadily, and without a quiver
in his voice,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is final. As sure as I love my wronged
country and hate everything this Northern
sun shines on, I will die before I will reveal
those things.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I triced him up by the thumbs again. When
the agony was full upon him, it was heart-breaking
to hear the poor thing’s shrieks, but
we got nothing else out of him. To every
question he screamed the same reply: “I can
die, and I <em>will</em> die; but I will never tell.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Well, we had to give it up. We were convinced
that he certainly would die rather than
confess. So we took him down and imprisoned
him, under strict guard.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then for some hours we busied ourselves
with sending telegrams to the War Department,
and with making preparations for a descent
upon No. 166.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was stirring times, that black and bitter
night. Things had leaked out, and the whole
garrison was on the alert. The sentinels were
trebled, and nobody could move, outside or in,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>without being brought to a stand with a musket
levelled at his head. However, Webb and
I were less concerned now than we had previously
been, because of the fact that the conspiracy
must necessarily be in a pretty crippled
condition, since so many of its principals were
in our clutches.</p>

<p class='c013'>I determined to be at No. 166 in good season,
capture and gag B. B., and be on hand
for the rest when they arrived. At about a
quarter past one in the morning I crept out of
the fortress with half a dozen stalwart and
gamy U.S. regulars at my heels—and the boy
Wicklow, with his hands tied behind him. I
told him we were going to No. 166, and that if
I found he had lied again and was misleading
us, he would have to show us the right place
or suffer the consequences.</p>

<p class='c013'>We approached the tavern stealthily and
reconnoitred. A light was burning in the
small bar-room, the rest of the house was
dark. I tried the front door; it yielded, and
we softly entered, closing the door behind us.
Then we removed our shoes, and I led the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>way to the bar-room. The German landlord
sat there, asleep in his chair. I woke him
gently, and told him to take off his boots and
precede us; warning him at the same time to
utter no sound. He obeyed without a murmur,
but evidently he was badly frightened.
I ordered him to lead the way to 166. We
ascended two or three flights of stairs as softly
as a file of cats; and then, having arrived near
the farther end of a long hall, we came to a
door through the glazed transom of which we
could discern the glow of a dim light from
within. The landlord felt for me in the dark
and whispered me that that was 166. I tried
the door—it was locked on the inside. I whispered
an order to one of my biggest soldiers;
we set our ample shoulders to the door and
with one heave we burst it from its hinges. I
caught a half-glimpse of a figure in a bed—saw
its head dart toward the candle; out went
the light, and we were in pitch darkness.
With one big bound I lit on that bed and
pinned its occupant down with my knees. My
prisoner struggled fiercely, but I got a grip on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>his throat with my left hand, and that was a
good assistance to my knees in holding him
down. Then straightway I snatched out my
revolver, cocked it, and laid the cold barrel
warningly against his cheek.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now somebody strike a light!” said I.
“I’ve got him safe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was done. The flame of the match burst
up. I looked at my captive, and, by George,
it was a young woman!</p>

<p class='c013'>I let go and got off the bed, feeling pretty
sheepish. Everybody stared stupidly at his
neighbor. Nobody had any wit or sense left,
so sudden and overwhelming had been the
surprise. The young woman began to cry,
and covered her face with the sheet. The
landlord said, meekly,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My daughter, she has been doing something
that is not right, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">nicht wahr</span></i>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your daughter? Is she your daughter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, she is my daughter. She is just
to-night come home from Cincinnati a little
bit sick.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Confound it, that boy has lied again. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>is not the right 166; this is not B. B. Now,
Wicklow, you will find the correct 166 for us,
or—hello! where is that boy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Gone, as sure as guns! And, what is more,
we failed to find a trace of him. Here was an
awkward predicament. I cursed my stupidity
in not tying him to one of the men; but it was
of no use to bother about that now. What
should I do in the present circumstances?—that
was the question. That girl <em>might</em> be
B. B., after all. I did not believe it, but still it
would not answer to take unbelief for proof.
So I finally put my men in a vacant room
across the hall from 166, and told them to capture
anybody and everybody that approached
the girl’s room, and to keep the landlord with
them, and under strict watch, until further orders.
Then I hurried back to the fort to see
if all was right there yet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, all was right. And all remained right.
I stayed up all night to make sure of that.
Nothing happened. I was unspeakably glad
to see the dawn come again, and be able
to telegraph the Department that the Stars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and Stripes still floated over Fort Trumbull.</p>

<p class='c013'>An immense pressure was lifted from my
breast. Still I did not relax vigilance, of
course, nor effort either; the case was too
grave for that. I had up my prisoners, one by
one, and harried them by the hour, trying to
get them to confess, but it was a failure. They
only gnashed their teeth and tore their hair,
and revealed nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>About noon came tidings of my missing boy.
He had been seen on the road, tramping westward,
some eight miles out, at six in the morning.
I started a cavalry lieutenant and a private
on his track at once. They came in sight
of him twenty miles out. He had climbed a
fence and was wearily dragging himself across
a slushy field toward a large old-fashioned
mansion in the edge of a village. They rode
through a bit of woods, made a detour, and
closed up on the house from the opposite side;
then dismounted and skurried into the kitchen.
Nobody there. They slipped into the next
room, which was also unoccupied; the door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>from that room into the front or sitting-room
was open. They were about to step through
it when they heard a low voice; it was somebody
praying. So they halted reverently, and
the lieutenant put his head in and saw an old
man and an old woman kneeling in a corner
of that sitting-room. It was the old man that
was praying, and just as he was finishing his
prayer, the Wicklow boy opened the front
door and stepped in. Both of those old people
sprang at him and smothered him with embraces,
shouting,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our boy! our darling! God be praised.
The lost is found! He that was dead is alive
again!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Well, sir, what do you think! That young
imp was born and reared on that homestead,
and had never been five miles away from it in
all his life, till the fortnight before he loafed
into my quarters and gulled me with that
maudlin yarn of his! It’s as true as gospel.
That old man was his father—a learned old
retired clergyman; and that old lady was his
mother.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Let me throw in a word or two of explanation
concerning that boy and his performances.
It turned out that he was a ravenous devourer
of dime novels and sensation-story papers—therefore,
dark mysteries and gaudy heroisms
were just in his line. Then he had read newspaper
reports of the stealthy goings and comings
of rebel spies in our midst, and of their
lurid purposes and their two or three startling
achievements, till his imagination was all
aflame on that subject. His constant comrade
for some months had been a Yankee youth of
much tongue and lively fancy, who had served
for a couple of years as “mud clerk” (that is,
subordinate purser) on certain of the packet-boats
plying between New Orleans and points
two or three hundred miles up the Mississippi—hence
his easy facility in handling the names
and other details pertaining to that region.
Now I had spent two or three months in that
part of the country before the war; and I knew
just enough about it to be easily taken in by
that boy, whereas a born Louisianian would
probably have caught him tripping before he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>had talked fifteen minutes. Do you know the
reason he said he would rather die than explain
certain of his treasonable enigmas?
Simply because he <em>couldn’t</em> explain them!—they
had no meaning; he had fired them out
of his imagination without forethought or afterthought;
and so, upon sudden call, he wasn’t
able to invent an explanation of them. For
instance, he couldn’t reveal what was hidden
in the “sympathetic ink” letter, for the ample
reason that there wasn’t anything hidden in
it; it was blank paper only. He hadn’t put
anything into a gun, and had never intended
to—for his letters were all written to imaginary
persons, and when he hid one in the stable he
always removed the one he had put there the
day before; so he was not acquainted with
that knotted string, since he was seeing it for
the first time when I showed it to him; but as
soon as I had let him find out where it came
from, he straightway adopted it, in his romantic
fashion, and got some fine effects out of it.
He invented Mr. “Gaylord;” there wasn’t
any 15 Bond Street, just then—it had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>pulled down three months before. He invented
the “Colonel;” he invented the glib
histories of those unfortunates whom I captured
and confronted with him; he invented
“B. B.;” he even invented No. 166, one may
say, for he didn’t know there <em>was</em> such a
number in the Eagle Hotel until we went
there. He stood ready to invent anybody or
anything whenever it was wanted. If I called
for “outside” spies, he promptly described
strangers whom he had seen at the hotel, and
whose names he had happened to hear. Ah,
he lived in a gorgeous, mysterious, romantic
world during those few stirring days, and I
think it was <em>real</em> to him, and that he enjoyed
it clear down to the bottom of his heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>But he made trouble enough for us, and just
no end of humiliation. You see, on account
of him we had fifteen or twenty people under
arrest and confinement in the fort, with sentinels
before their doors. A lot of the captives
were soldiers and such, and to them I didn’t
have to apologize; but the rest were first-class
citizens, from all over the country, and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>amount of apologies was sufficient to satisfy
them. They just fumed and raged and made
no end of trouble! And those two ladies,—one
was an Ohio Congressman’s wife, the other
a Western bishop’s sister,—well, the scorn and
ridicule and angry tears they poured out on
me made up a keepsake that was likely to
make me remember them for a considerable
time,—and I shall. That old lame gentleman
with the goggles was a college president from
Philadelphia, who had come up to attend his
nephew’s funeral. He had never seen young
Wicklow before, of course. Well, he not only
missed the funeral, and got jailed as a rebel
spy, but Wicklow had stood up there in my
quarters and coldly described him as a counterfeiter,
nigger-trader, horse-thief, and fire-bug
from the most notorious rascal-nest in Galveston;
and this was a thing which that poor old
gentleman couldn’t seem to get over at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the War Department! But, O my
soul, let’s draw the curtain over that part!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c013'>Note.—I showed my manuscript to the Major, and he
said: “Your unfamiliarity with military matters has betrayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>you into some little mistakes. Still, they are picturesque
ones—let them go; military men will smile at
them, the rest won’t detect them. You have got the main
facts of the history right, and have set them down just
about as they occurred.”—M. T.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>MRS. McWILLIAMS AND THE LIGHTNING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c016'>Well, sir,—continued Mr. McWilliams,
for this was not the beginning of his
talk;—the fear of lightning is one of the most
distressing infirmities a human being can be
afflicted with. It is mostly confined to women;
but now and then you find it in a little dog,
and sometimes in a man. It is a particularly
distressing infirmity, for the reason that it
takes the sand out of a person to an extent
which no other fear can, and it can’t be <em>reasoned</em>
with, and neither can it be shamed out
of a person. A woman who could face the
very devil himself—or a mouse—loses her grip
and goes all to pieces in front of a flash of
lightning. Her fright is something pitiful to
see.</p>

<p class='c013'>Well, as I was telling you, I woke up, with
that smothered and unlocatable cry of “Mortimer!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Mortimer!” wailing in my ears; and
as soon as I could scrape my faculties together
I reached over in the dark and then said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Evangeline, is that you calling? What is
the matter? Where are you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shut up in the boot-closet. You ought to
be ashamed to lie there and sleep so, and such
an awful storm going on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, how <em>can</em> one be ashamed when he is
asleep? It is unreasonable; a man <em>can’t</em> be
ashamed when he is asleep, Evangeline.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never try, Mortimer,—you know very
well you never try.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I caught the sound of muffled sobs.</p>

<p class='c013'>That sound smote dead the sharp speech
that was on my lips, and I changed it to—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m sorry, dear,—I’m truly sorry. I never
meant to act so. Come back and—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Mortimer!</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heavens! what is the matter, my love?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you mean to say you are in that bed
yet?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, of course.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come out of it instantly. I should think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>you would take some <em>little</em> care of your life, for
<em>my</em> sake and the children’s, if you will not for
your own.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But my love—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t talk to me, Mortimer. You <em>know</em>
there is no place so dangerous as a bed, in
such a thunder-storm as this,—all the books
say that; yet there you would lie, and deliberately
throw away your life,—for goodness
knows what, unless for the sake of arguing and
arguing, and—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, confound it, Evangeline, I’m <em>not</em> in the
bed, <em>now</em>. I’m—”</p>

<p class='c013'>[Sentence interrupted by a sudden glare of
lightning, followed by a terrified little scream
from Mrs. McWilliams and a tremendous blast
of thunder.]</p>

<p class='c013'>“There! You see the result. Oh, Mortimer,
how <em>can</em> you be so profligate as to swear
at such a time as this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I <em>didn’t</em> swear. And that <em>wasn’t</em> a result
of it, any way. It would have come, just the
same, if I hadn’t said a word; and you know
very well, Evangeline,—at least you ought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>know,—that when the atmosphere is charged
with electricity—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, now argue it, and argue it, and
argue it!—I don’t see how you can act so,
when you <em>know</em> there is not a lightning-rod on
the place, and your poor wife and children are
absolutely at the mercy of Providence. What
<em>are</em> you doing?—lighting a match at such a
time as this! Are you stark mad?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hang it, woman, where’s the harm? The
place is as dark as the inside of an infidel,
and—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put it out! put it out instantly! Are you
determined to sacrifice us all? You <em>know</em> there
is nothing attracts lightning like a light. [<em>Fzt!—crash!
boom—boloom-boom-boom!</em>] Oh,
just hear it! Now you see what you’ve
done!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I <em>don’t</em> see what I’ve done. A match
may attract lightning, for all I know, but it
don’t <em>cause</em> lightning,—I’ll go odds on that.
And it didn’t attract it worth a cent this time;
for if that shot was levelled at my match, it
was blessed poor marksmanship,—about an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>average of none out of a possible million, I
should say. Why, at Dollymount, such marksmanship
as that—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For shame, Mortimer! Here we are
standing right in the very presence of death,
and yet in so solemn a moment you are capable
of using such language as that. If you
have no desire to—Mortimer!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you say your prayers to-night?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I—I—meant to, but I got to trying to
cipher out how much twelve times thirteen is,
and—”</p>

<p class='c013'>[<em>Fzt!—boom-berroom-boom! bumble-umble
bang</em>-<span class='fss'>SMASH</span>!]</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, we are lost, beyond all help! How
<em>could</em> you neglect such a thing at such a time
as this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But it <em>wasn’t</em> ‘such a time as this.’ There
wasn’t a cloud in the sky. How could <em>I</em> know
there was going to be all this rumpus and powwow
about a little slip like that? And I don’t
think it’s just fair for you to make so much out
of it, any way, seeing it happens so seldom; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>haven’t missed before since I brought on that
earthquake, four years ago.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Mortimer!</span> How you talk! Have you
forgotten the yellow fever?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear, you are always throwing up the
yellow fever to me, and I think it is perfectly
unreasonable. You can’t even send a telegraphic
message as far as Memphis without
relays, so how is a little devotional slip of
mine going to carry so far? I’ll <em>stand</em> the
earthquake, because it was in the neighborhood;
but I’ll be hanged if I’m going to be responsible
for every blamed—”</p>

<p class='c013'>[<em>Fzt!</em>—<span class='fss'>BOOM</span> <em>beroom</em>-boom! boom!—BANG!]</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, dear, dear, dear! I <em>know</em> it struck
something, Mortimer. We never shall see the
light of another day; and if it will do you any
good to remember, when we are gone, that
your dreadful language—<em>Mortimer</em>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Well!</span> What now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your voice sounds as if— Mortimer, are
you actually standing in front of that open
fireplace?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“That is the very crime I am committing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get away from it, this moment. You do
seem determined to bring destruction on us
all. Don’t you <em>know</em> that there is no better
conductor for lightning than an open chimney?
<em>Now</em> where have you got to?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m here by the window.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, for pity’s sake, have you lost your
mind? Clear out from there, this moment.
The very children in arms know it is fatal to
stand near a window in a thunder-storm.
Dear, dear, I know I shall never see the light
of another day. Mortimer?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is that rustling?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Trying to find the upper end of my pantaloons.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quick! throw those things away! I do
believe you would deliberately put on those
clothes at such a time as this; yet you know
perfectly well that <em>all</em> authorities agree that
woolen stuffs attract lightning. Oh, dear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>dear, it isn’t sufficient that one’s life must be in
peril from natural causes, but you must do
everything you can possibly think of to augment
the danger. Oh, <em>don’t</em> sing! What <em>can</em>
you be thinking of?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now where’s the harm in it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mortimer, if I have told you once, I have
told you a hundred times, that singing causes
vibrations in the atmosphere which interrupt
the flow of the electric fluid, and—What on
<em>earth</em> are you opening that door for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goodness gracious, woman, is there is any
harm in <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Harm?</em> There’s <em>death</em> in it. Anybody
that has given this subject any attention knows
that to create a draught is to invite the lightning.
You haven’t half shut it; shut it <em>tight</em>,—and
do hurry, or we are all destroyed. Oh,
it is an awful thing to be shut up with a lunatic
at such a time as this. Mortimer, what <em>are</em> you
doing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing. Just turning on the water.
This room is smothering hot and close. I
want to bathe my face and hands.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“You have certainly parted with the remnant
of your mind! Where lightning strikes
any other substance once, it strikes water fifty
times. Do turn it off. Oh, dear, I am sure
that nothing in this world can save us. It does
seem to me that—Mortimer, what was that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was a da—it was a picture. Knocked
it down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you are close to the wall! I never
heard of such imprudence! Don’t you <em>know</em>
that there’s no better conductor for lightning
than a wall? Come away from there! And
you came as near as anything to swearing,
too. Oh, how can you be so desperately
wicked, and your family in such peril? Mortimer,
did you order a feather bed, as I asked
you to do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No. Forgot it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgot it! It may cost you your life. If
you had a feather bed, now, and could spread
it in the middle of the room and lie on it, you
would be perfectly safe. Come in here,—come
quick, before you have a chance to commit
any more frantic indiscretions.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>I tried, but the little closet would not hold
us both with the door shut, unless we could be
content to smother. I gasped awhile, then
forced my way out. My wife called out,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mortimer, something <em>must</em> be done for
your preservation. Give me that German book
that is on the end of the mantel-piece, and a
candle; but don’t light it; give me a match; I
will light it in here. That book has some
directions in it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I got the book,—at cost of a vase and some
other brittle things; and the madam shut herself
up with her candle. I had a moment’s
peace; then she called out,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mortimer, what was that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing but the cat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The cat! Oh, destruction! Catch her,
and shut her up in the wash-stand. Do be
quick, love; cats are <em>full</em> of electricity. I just
know my hair will turn white with this night’s
awful perils.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I heard the muffled sobbings again. But for
that, I should not have moved hand or foot in
such a wild enterprise in the dark.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>However, I went at my task,—over chairs,
and against all sorts of obstructions, all of
them hard ones, too, and most of them with
sharp edges,—and at last I got kitty cooped
up in the commode, at an expense of over four
hundred dollars in broken furniture and shins.
Then these muffled words came from the
closet:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“It says the safest thing is to stand on a
chair in the middle of the room, Mortimer; and
the legs of the chair must be insulated, with
non-conductors. That is, you must set the
legs of the chair in glass tumblers. [<em>Fzt!—boom—bang!—smash!</em>]
Oh, hear that! Do
hurry, Mortimer, before you are struck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I managed to find and secure the tumblers.
I got the last four,—broke all the rest. I insulated
the chair legs, and called for further
instructions.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mortimer, it says, ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Während eines Gewitters
entferne man Metalle, wie z. B., Ringe,
Uhren, Schlüssel, etc., von sich und halte sich
auch nicht an solchen Stellen auf, wo viele
Metalle bei einander liegen, oder mit andern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Körpern verbunden sind, wie an Herden,
Oefen, Eisengittern u. dgl.</span>’ What does that
mean, Mortimer? Does it mean that you
must keep metals <em>about</em> you, or keep them <em>away</em>
from you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I hardly know. It appears to be a
little mixed. All German advice is more or
less mixed. However, I think that that sentence
is mostly in the dative case, with a little
genitive and accusative sifted in, here and
there, for luck; so I reckon it means that you
must keep some metals <em>about</em> you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, that must be it. It stands to reason
that it is. They are in the nature of lightning-rods,
you know. Put on your fireman’s helmet,
Mortimer; that is mostly metal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I got it and put it on,—a very heavy and
clumsy and uncomfortable thing on a hot night
in a close room. Even my night-dress seemed
to be more clothing than I strictly needed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mortimer, I think your middle ought to be
protected. Won’t you buckle on your militia
sabre, please?”</p>

<p class='c013'>I complied.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Now, Mortimer, you ought to have some
way to protect your feet. Do please put on
your spurs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I did it,—in silence,—and kept my temper
as well as I could.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mortimer, it says, ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Gewitter läuten ist
sehr gefährlich, weil die Glocke selbst, sowie
der durch das Läuten veranlasste Luftzug und
die Höhe des Thurmes den Blitz anziehen
könnten.</span>’ Mortimer, does that mean that it is
dangerous not to ring the church bells during
a thunder-storm?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, it seems to mean that,—if that is the
past participle of the nominative case singular,
and I reckon it is. Yes, I think it means that
on account of the height of the church tower
and the absence of <em>Luftzug</em> it would be very
dangerous (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">sehr gefährlich</span></i>) not to ring the
bells in time of a storm; and moreover, don’t
you see, the very wording—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never mind that, Mortimer; don’t waste
the precious time in talk. Get the large dinner-bell;
it is right there in the hall. Quick,
Mortimer dear; we are almost safe. Oh, dear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>I do believe we are going to be saved, at
last!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Our little summer establishment stands on
top of a high range of hills, overlooking a valley.
Several farm-houses are in our neighborhood,—the
nearest some three or four hundred
yards away.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I, mounted on the chair, had been
clanging that dreadful bell a matter of seven or
eight minutes, our shutters were suddenly torn
open from without, and a brilliant bull’s-eye
lantern was thrust in at the window, followed
by a hoarse inquiry:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What in the nation is the matter here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The window was full of men’s heads, and
the heads were full of eyes that stared wildly
at my night-dress and my warlike accoutrements.</p>

<p class='c013'>I dropped the bell, skipped down from the
chair in confusion, and said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is nothing the matter, friends,—only
a little discomfort on account of the
thunder-storm. I was trying to keep off the
lightning.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Thunder-storm? Lightning? Why, Mr.
McWilliams, have you lost your mind? It is
a beautiful starlight night; there has been no
storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I looked out, and I was so astonished
I could hardly speak for a while. Then I
said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not understand this. We distinctly
saw the glow of the flashes through the curtains
and shutters, and heard the thunder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>One after another of those people lay down
on the ground to laugh,—and two of them
died. One of the survivors remarked,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pity you didn’t think to open your blinds
and look over to the top of the high hill yonder.
What you heard was cannon; what you
saw was the flash. You see, the telegraph
brought some news, just at midnight: Garfield’s
nominated,—and that’s what’s the matter!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, Mr. Twain, as I was saying in the beginning
(said Mr. McWilliams), the rules for
preserving people against lightning are so excellent
and so innumerable that the most incomprehensible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>thing in the world to me is how
anybody ever manages to get struck.</p>

<p class='c013'>So saying, he gathered up his satchel and
umbrella, and departed; for the train had
reached his town.</p>
<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>[<span class='sc'>Explanatory.</span> I regard the idea of this play as a
valuable invention. I call it the Patent Universally-Applicable
Automatically-Adjustable Language Drama.
This indicates that it is adjustable to any tongue,
and performable in any tongue. The English portions
of the play are to remain just as they are, permanently;
but you change the foreign portions to any language
you please, at will. Do you see? You at once
have the same old play in a new tongue. And you can
keep on changing it from language to language, until
your private theatrical pupils have become glib and at
home in the speech of all nations. <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zum Beispiel</span></i>, suppose
we wish to adjust the play to the French tongue.
First, we give Mrs. Blumenthal and Gretchen French
names. Next, we knock the German <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meisterschaft</span>
sentences out of the first scene, and replace them with
sentences from the French <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meisterschaft</span>-like this, for
instance; “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je voudrais faire des emplettes ce matin;
voulez-vous avoir l’obligeance de venir avec moi chez
le tailleur français?</span>” And so on. Wherever you find
German, replace it with French, leaving the English
parts undisturbed. When you come to the long conversation
in the second act, turn to any pamphlet of
your French <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meisterschaft</span>, and shovel in as much
French talk on <em>any</em> subject as will fill up the gaps
left by the expunged German. Example—page 423
French <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meisterschaft</span>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c013'>Scene of the play, the parlor of a small private dwelling
in a village.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Margaret.</span> (<em>Discovered crocheting—has a pamphlet.</em>)</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Margaret.</span> (<em>Solus.</em>) Dear, dear! it’s
dreary enough, to have to study this impossible
German tongue: to be exiled from home
and all human society except a body’s sister in
order to do it, is just simply abscheulich. Here’s
only three weeks of the three months gone,
and it seems like three years. I don’t believe
I can live through it, and I’m sure Annie can’t.</p>

<p class='c013'>(<em>Refers to her book, and rattles through, several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>times, like one memorizing</em>:) <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Entschuldigen
Sie, mein Herr, können Sie mir vielleicht
sagen, um wie viel Uhr der erste Zug nach
Dresden abgeht?</span> (<em>Makes mistakes and corrects
them.</em>) I just hate <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meisterschaft</span>! We
may see people; we can have society: yes,
on condition that the conversation shall be in
German, and in German only—every single
word of it! Very kind—oh, very! when
neither Annie nor I can put two words together,
except as they are put together for us in
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meisterschaft</span> or that idiotic Ollendorff! (<em>Refers
to book, and memorizes: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mein Bruder hat
Ihren Herrn Vater nicht gesehen, als er gestern
in dem Laden des deutschen Kaufmannes war.</span></em>)
Yes, we can have society, provided we talk
German. What would such a conversation be
like! If you should stick to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meisterschaft</span>, it
would change the subject every two minutes;
and if you stuck to Ollendorff, it would be all
about your sister’s mother’s good stocking of
thread, or your grandfather’s aunt’s good hammer
of the carpenter, and who’s got it, and
there an end. You couldn’t keep up your interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>in such topics. (<em>Memorizing: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wenn
irgend möglich,—möchte ich noch heute Vormittag
dort ankommen, da es mir sehr daran
gelegen ist, einen meiner Geschäftsfreunde zu
treffen.</span></em>) My mind is made up to one thing: I
will be an exile, in spirit and in truth: I will
see no one during these three months. Father
is very ingenious—oh, very! thinks he is, anyway.
Thinks he has invented a way to <em>force</em>
us to learn to speak German. He is a dear
good soul, and all that; but invention isn’t his
fash’. He will see. (<em>With eloquent energy.</em>)
Why, nothing in the world shall—<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bitte, können
Sie mir vielleicht sagen, ob Herr Schmidt
mit diesem Zuge angekommen ist?</span> Oh, dear,
dear George—three weeks! It seems a whole
century since I saw him. I wonder if he suspects
that I—that I—care for him——j—just a
wee, wee bit? I believe he does. And I believe
Will suspects that Annie cares for <em>him</em> a
little, that I do. And I know perfectly well
that they care for <em>us</em>. They agree with all our
opinions, no matter what they are; and if they
have a prejudice, they change it, as soon as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>they see how foolish it is. Dear George! at
first he just couldn’t abide cats; but now, why
now he’s just all for cats; he fairly welters in
cats. I never saw such a reform. And it’s
just so with <em>all</em> his principles: he hasn’t got
one that he had before. Ah, if all men were
like him, this world would——(<em>Memorizing:
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Im Gegentheil, mein Herr, dieser Stoff is sehr
billig. Bitte, sehen Sie sich nur die Qualität
an.</span></em>) Yes, and what did <em>they</em> go to studying
German for, if it wasn’t an inspiration of the
highest and purest sympathy? Any other explanation
is nonsense——why, they’d as soon
have thought of studying American history.

this time struggling and despairing over these

you live, I’ll have the whole fifteen by heart
before this time day after to-morrow. See if I
don’t.</p>

<p class='c013'>A. And so will I; and I’ll trowel-in a layer

<p class='c013'>M. Reasons?—what reasons?</p>

<p class='c013'>A. Well, now, when you stop and think,
they’re royal good ones. They’ve got to talk

<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wie befinden Sie sich, and Haben Sie gut
geschlafen, and Vater unser, and Ich trinke
lieber Bier als Wasser</span>, and a few little parlor
things like that; but when it comes to <em>talking</em>,
why, they don’t know a hundred and fifty German
words, put them all together.</p>

<p class='c013'>M. Oh, I see!</p>

<p class='c013'>A. So they’re going neither to eat, sleep,

<blockquote>
<p class='c013'>Enter Mr. Stephenson.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Stephenson.</span> Good morning, Mrs. Blumenthal—keep
your seat, keep your seat, please.
I’m only here for a moment—merely to get
your report, you know. (<em>Seating himself.</em>)
Don’t want to see the girls—poor things,
they’d want to go home with me. I’m afraid
I couldn’t have the heart to say no. How’s
the German getting along?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> N-not very well; I was afraid you
would ask me that. You see, they hate it, they
don’t take the least interest in it, and there
isn’t anything to incite them to an interest, you
see. And so they can’t talk at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>S. M-m. That’s bad. I had an idea that
they’d get lonesome, and have to seek society;
and then, of course, my plan would work, considering
the cast-iron conditions of it.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> But it hasn’t so far. I’ve thrown
nice company in their way—I’ve done my very
best, in every way I could think of—but it’s no
use; they won’t go out, and they won’t receive
anybody. And a body can’t blame them;
they’d be tongue-tied—couldn’t do anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>with a German conversation. Now when I
started to learn German—such poor German as
I know—the case was very different: my intended
was a German. I was to live among
Germans the rest of my life; and so I <em>had</em> to
learn. Why, bless my heart! I nearly <em>lost</em>
the man the first time he asked me—I thought
he was talking about the measles. They were
very prevalent at the time. Told him I didn’t
want any in mine. But I found out the mistake,
and I was fixed for him next time... Oh,
yes, Mr. Stephenson, a sweetheart’s a prime
incentive!</p>

<p class='c013'>S. (<em>Aside.</em>) Good soul! she doesn’t suspect
that my plan is a double scheme—includes a
speaking knowledge of German, which I am
bound they shall have, and the keeping them
away from those two young fellows—though if
I had known that those boys were going off for
a year’s foreign travel, I—however, the girls
would never learn that language at home;
they’re here, and I won’t relent—they’ve got
to stick the three months out. (<em>Aloud.</em>) So
they are making poor progress? Now tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>me—will they learn it—after a sort of fashion,
I mean—in the three months?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> Well, now, I’ll tell you the only
chance I see. Do what I will, they won’t answer
my German with anything but English;
if that goes on, they’ll stand stock still. Now
I’m willing to do this: I’ll straighten everything
up, get matters in smooth running order,
and day after to-morrow I’ll go to bed sick, and
stay sick three weeks.</p>

<p class='c013'>S. Good! You are an angel! I see your
idea. The servant girl—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> That’s it; that’s my project. She
doesn’t know a word of English. And Gretchen’s
a real good soul, and can talk the slates
off a roof. Her tongue’s just a flutter-mill. I’ll
keep my room,—just ailing a little,—and
they’ll never see my face except when they pay
their little duty-visits to me, and then I’ll say
English disorders my mind. They’ll be shut
up with Gretchen’s wind-mill, and she’ll just
grind them to powder. Oh, <em>they’ll</em> get a start
in the language—sort of a one, sure’s you live.
You come back in three weeks.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>S. Bless you, my Retterin! I’ll be here to
the day! Get ye to your sick-room—you
shall have treble pay. (<em>Looking at watch.</em>)

there’s so <em>many</em> things—I don’t think a body
can choose beforehand, because you know the

so much to do in directing a conversation, especially

never saw anything like it in the whole course
of your life! It’s absolutely wonderful the
way it works.</p>

<p class='c013'>S. Succeeds? No—you don’t mean it.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> Indeed I do mean it. I tell you,
Mr. Stephenson, that plan was just an inspiration—that’s
what it was. You could teach a
cat German by it.</p>

<p class='c013'>S. Dear me, this is noble news! Tell me
about it.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> Well, it’s all Gretchen—every
bit of it. I told you she was a jewel. And
then the sagacity of that child—why, I never
dreamed it was in her. Sh-she, “Never you
ask the young ladies a question—never let on—just
keep mum—leave the whole thing to
me,” sh-she.</p>

<p class='c013'>S. Good! And she justified, did she?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> Well, sir, the amount of German
gabble that that child crammed into those two
girls inside the next forty-eight hours—well, <em>I</em>
was satisfied! So I’ve never asked a question—never
<em>wanted</em> to ask any. I’ve just lain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>curled up there, happy. The little dears! they’ve
flitted in to see me a moment, every morning
and noon and supper-time; and as sure as
I’m sitting here, inside of six days they were
clattering German to me like a house afire!</p>

<p class='c013'>S. Sp-lendid, splendid!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> Of course it ain’t grammatical—the
inventor of the language can’t talk grammatical;
if the Dative didn’t fetch him the Accusative
would; but it’s German all the same,
and don’t you forget it!</p>

<p class='c013'>S. Go on—go on—this is delicious news—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin</span>. Gretchen, she says to me at the
start, “Never you mind about company for
’em,” sh-she—“I’m company enough.” And
I says, “All right—fix it your own way,
child and that she <em>was</em> right is shown by the
fact that to this day they don’t care a straw for
any company but hers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>S. Dear me; why, it’s admirable!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> Well, I should think so! They just
dote on that hussy—can’t seem to get enough
of her. Gretchen tells me so herself. And the
care she takes of them! She tells me that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>every time there’s a moonlight night she coaxes
them out for a walk; and if a body can believe
her, she actually bullies them off to church
three times every Sunday!</p>

<p class='c013'>S. Why, the little dev—missionary! Really,
she’s a genius!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> She’s a bud, <em>I</em> tell you! Dear
me, how she’s brought those girls’ health up!
Cheeks?—just roses. Gait?—they walk on
watch-springs! And happy?—by the bliss in
their eyes, you’d think they’re in Paradise!
Ah, that Gretchen! Just you imagine <em>our</em>
trying to achieve these marvels!</p>

<p class='c013'>S. You’re right—every time. Those girls—why,
all they’d have wanted to know was
what we wanted done—and then they wouldn’t
have <em>done</em> it—the mischievous young rascals!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> Don’t tell <em>me</em>? Bless you, I found
that out early—when <em>I</em> was bossing.</p>

<p class='c013'>S. Well, I’m im-mensely pleased. <em>Now</em>
fetch them down. I’m not afraid now. They
won’t want to go home.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> Home! I don’t believe you could
drag them away from Gretchen with nine span
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>of horses. But if you want to see them, put on
your hat and come along; they’re out somewhere
trapsing along with Gretchen. (<span class='sc'>Going.</span>)</p>

<p class='c013'>S. I’m with you—lead on.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Wirthin.</span> We’ll go out the side door. It’s
toward the Anlage.</p>

<p class='c027'><b>Flower o’ the Vine: Romantic Ballads and Sospiri
di Roma.</b>—This volume contains the poems
in Mr. Sharp’s latest books of verse, now entirely out of
print. His collaboration with Blanche Willis Howard
in the novel “A Fellowe and His Wife,” has made his
name familiar to American readers. As one of the most
popular of the younger English poets, we anticipate an
equal success in America for “Flower o’ the Vine,” for
which Mr. Thomas A. Janvier has prepared an Introduction.
Handsomely bound, uniform with Aldrich’s
“Sisters’ Tragedy” and Cora Fabbri’s “Lyrics.” Cloth,
$1.50.</p>

<p class='c027'><b>Moonblight and Three Feet of Romance.</b>—Octavo,
300 pages, fully illustrated. This story we believe
will take rank with “Looking Backward.” It treats of
some of the great social problems of the day in a novel,
powerful, and intensely interesting manner. The hero
becomes strangely endowed with the power of seeing
people in their true light. It is needless to say that this
power proves both a curse and a blessing, and leads to
many and strange adventures. Mr. Beard’s reputation
as an artist is world-wide, and the numerous illustrations
he provides for this book powerfully portray the
spirit of the text. Cloth, ink and gold stamps, $2.00.</p>
